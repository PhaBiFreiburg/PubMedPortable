	<tr><td>0</td><td>28245267</td><td>Knowledge of risk factors for diabetes or cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>) is poor among individuals with risk factors for <b>CVD</b>.</td><td>BACKGROUND:
There is limited evidence on whether having pre-existing cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>) or risk factors for <b>CVD</b> such as diabetes, ensures greater knowledge of risk factors important for motivating preventative behaviours. Our objective was to compare knowledge among the Australian public participating in a health check program and their risk status.
METHODS:
Data from the Stroke Foundation 'Know your numbers' program were used. Staff in community pharmacies provided opportunistic health checks (measurement of blood pressure and diabetes risk assessment) among their customers. Participants were categorised: 1) <b>CVD</b> ± risk of <b>CVD</b>: history of stroke, heart disease or kidney disease, and may have risk factors; 2) risk of <b>CVD</b> only: reported having high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes or atrial fibrillation; and 3) <b>CVD</b> risk free (no <b>CVD</b> or risk of <b>CVD</b>). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed including adjustment for age and sex.
FINDINGS:
Among 4,647 participants, 12% had <b>CVD</b> (55% male, 85% aged 55+ years), 47% were at risk of <b>CVD</b> (40% male, 72% 55+ years) and 41% were <b>CVD</b> risk free (33% male, 27% 55+ years). Participants with <b>CVD</b> (OR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.55, 0.80) or risk factors for <b>CVD</b> (OR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.57, 0.73) had poorer knowledge of the risk factors for diabetes<b>CVD</b> compared to those who were <b>CVD</b> risk free. After adjustment, only participants with risk factors for <b>CVD</b> (OR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.69, 0.93) had poorer knowledge. Older participants (55+ years) and men had poorer knowledge of diabetes<b>CVD</b> risk factors and complications of diabetes.
CONCLUSIONS:
Participants with poorer knowledge of risk factors were older, more often male or were at risk of developing <b>CVD</b> compared with those who were <b>CVD</b> risk free. Health education in these high risk groups should be a priority, as diabetes and <b>CVD</b> are increasing in prevalence throughout the world.
</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>11708592</td><td>Major cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>) during 1997-1999 and major <b>CVD</b> hospital discharge rates in 1997 among women with diabetes--United States.</td><td>Cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>) is the leading cause of death among all women and the risk for death from <b>CVD</b> among women with diabetes is two to four times higher than that for women without diabetes. The excess risk for death as the result of <b>CVD</b> among persons with diabetes is better understood than the excess risk for <b>CVD</b> morbidity. To estimate national <b>CVD</b> prevalence and <b>CVD</b> hospital use among women with diabetes, CDC and the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality (AHRQ) analyzed data from the 1997-1999 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and the 1997 Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS). Findings indicate that the age-adjusted prevalence of major <b>CVD</b> for women with diabetes is twice that for women without diabetes and that the age-adjusted major <b>CVD</b> hospital discharge rate for women with diabetes is almost four times the rate for women without diabetes. These findings underscore the need to reduce risk factors associated with <b>CVD</b> among all women with diabetes through focused public health and clinical efforts.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>17288695</td><td>Comparison of health care costs and co-morbidities between men diagnosed with benign prostatic hyperplasia and cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>) and men with <b>CVD</b> alone in a US commercial population.</td><td>OBJECTIVE:
The purpose of this study was to compare costs and treatment patterns between men with concomitant benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and <b>CVD</b> to men with <b>CVD</b> (but not BPH).
STUDY DESIGN:
A retrospective, matched cohort study was utilized to assess costs and treatment between two study populations.
METHODS:
The data source was administrative claims from managed care organizations between January 1, 1997 and December 31, 2004. A control group of men with <b>CVD</b> only was created matching by age, index <b>CVD</b> diagnosis date, and <b>CVD</b> diagnoses. Diagnosis and procedure codes identified men with BPH and <b>CVD</b>. Differences in medical costs, co-morbidities, and drug treatments were assessed.
RESULTS:
Approximately 39% of men identified with BPH also had some form of <b>CVD</b> at the time of BPH diagnosis. Men with BPH and <b>CVD</b> were more likely to have additional co-morbidities, more frequently received medications for <b>CVD</b> and non-<b>CVD</b> disorders, had 44% higher total medical costs than men with <b>CVD</b> only (p  0.001), and had 42% higher <b>CVD</b>-related costs (p  0.001) than men with <b>CVD</b> only.
LIMITATIONS:
The population studied in this analysis was primarily working individuals with health benefits provided by managed care plans; therefore, the results may not generalize to other populations.
CONCLUSIONS:
This study demonstrates in a commercial payer population that men with concomitant BPH and <b>CVD</b> have more co-morbidities, receive pharmacologic agents more frequently, and have higher health care resource utilization than men with <b>CVD</b> only. Due to the high prevalence of co-morbid BPH and <b>CVD</b>, screening for BPH in men presenting with <b>CVD</b> may assist with earlier disease identification and cost management over time.
</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>12477139</td><td>Differential impact of cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>) risk factor clustering on <b>CVD</b> and renal disease among African-American and white patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.</td><td>OBJECTIVES:
To determine if clustering of cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>) risk factors has a differential impact on <b>CVD</b> and renal disease among African Americans compared to Whites with type 2 diabetes
DESIGN:
Cross-sectional.
METHODS:
Prevalent <b>CVD</b>, macroalbuminuria, and <b>CVD</b> risk factors were measured in 323 African-American and White adult patients with type 2 diabetes. <b>CVD</b> risk factors were dichotomized according to standard guidelines. Data were analyzed by race according to the presence of any 3 or more <b>CVD</b> risk factors.
RESULTS:
Despite a similar prevalence of hypertension, the prevalence of macroalbuminuria in the presence of 3 or more <b>CVD</b> risk factors tended to be higher among African Americans compared to Whites (28.9% vs 13.6%, P = 0.05). The presence of 3+ <b>CVD</b> risk factors was associated with an odds ratio (OR) of 2.5 (P = 0.001, 95% CI, 1.44-4.27) for macroalbuminuria in African Americans compared to an OR of 1.4 (P = 0.25, 95% CI, 0.78-2.53) in Whites. The race3+ <b>CVD</b> risk factors interaction was statistically significant (P = 0.007). Conversely, the presence of 3+ risk factors was associated with an OR of 1.6 (P = 0.019, 95% CI, 1.08-2.28) for <b>CVD</b> in Whites compared to an OR of 0.8 (P = .287, 95% CI, 0.54-1.20) in African Americans. The prevalence of any <b>CVD</b> in the presence of 3+ risk factors was 61% and 49% in Whites and African Americans respectively (P = .217). The race3+ <b>CVD</b> risk factors interaction was statistically significant (P = 0.029).
CONCLUSIONS:
These findings suggest that among persons with diabetes, a clustering of 3+ <b>CVD</b> risk factors is more predictive for renal disease among African Americans, and more predictive for <b>CVD</b> in Whites. Further research should clarify the impact of <b>CVD</b> risk factor clustering on the incidence of vascular disease among African Americans and Whites with type 2 diabetes.
</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>16868574</td><td>Will a web-based cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>) risk assessment programme increase the assessment of <b>CVD</b> risk factors for Maori?</td><td>BACKGROUND:
Maori suffer disproportionately from cardiovascular disease despite the national priority of reducing inequalities. National guidelines on the clinical management of <b>CVD</b> risk recommend a comprehensive risk assessment be completed as a prerequisite for identifying patients most likely to benefit from treatment.
METHODS:
A retrospective audit of GPs using PREDICT-<b>CVD</b> (an electronic risk assessment and management tool) was designed with adequate explanatory power for Maori to determine if it could increase <b>CVD</b> risk assessment without increasing inequalities. 1680 electronic medical records (EMRs) prior to implementation and 1884 after implementation of PREDICT were audited.
RESULTS:
Documentation of <b>CVD</b> risk increased from 3.2% of EMRs to 14.7% of EMRs in Maori, and from 2.8% to 10.5% in non-Maori. The documentation of individual <b>CVD</b> risk factors also increased post-implementation of the tool.
CONCLUSIONS:
The implementation of PREDICT-<b>CVD</b> was as likely to increase documentation of <b>CVD</b> risk assessment and risk factors in Maori as in non-Maori. However documentation was still low in Maori despite known high prevalence of <b>CVD</b> risk factors. A comprehensive quality-driven implementation programme is recommended, including targeting risk assessment for those most in need.
</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>17853933</td><td>The impact of New Zealand <b>CVD</b> risk chart adjustments for family history and ethnicity on eligibility for treatment (PREDICT <b>CVD</b>-5).</td><td>AIMS:
Current New Zealand cardiovascular (<b>CVD</b>) risk management guidelines advocate targeting treatment to patients with a high 5-year <b>CVD</b> risk assessed using a calculator derived from the Framingham Heart Study. For some high-risk population subgroups, a 5% upward adjustment to their calculated 5-year <b>CVD</b> risk is recommended. We estimated the impact of these adjustments on eligibility for treatment in a primary care setting.
METHODS:
Between 2002 and 2006, 23,709 patients visiting their primary care provider in Auckland, New Zealand had <b>CVD</b> risk assessments as part of an opportunistic screening programme using PREDICT, a web-based clinical decision support system. We calculated their baseline <b>CVD</b> risk with and without the 5% upward adjustment for family history of premature ischaemic <b>CVD</b> or for being of Maori, Pacific or Indian subcontinent ethnicity.
RESULTS:
A baseline <b>CVD</b> risk could be calculated for 23,693 (99.9%) patients of whom 90% were between ages 35 and 74 years. Unadjusted risk scores classified the majority (70%) below the 10% 5-year risk threshold for specific individualised treatment. A further 11% were between 10 to 15% risk (recommended to receive individualised lifestyle counselling in general practice) and 19% had a greater than 15% risk ( recommended for drug treatment and referral to a dietician in addition to individualised lifestyle counselling). Over a quarter of patients were recorded as having a premature family history of <b>CVD</b>; 21% were Maori, Pacific, or Indian subcontinent and thus met the criteria for a single 5% upward adjustment. This increased the number of people eligible for drug treatment, intensive lifestyle management, and dietician referral by approximately 20% and individualised lifestyle assessment and counselling by 50%.
CONCLUSIONS:
The upward adjustments to the calculated <b>CVD</b> risk recommended by the New Zealand <b>CVD</b> risk management guidelines has the potential to substantially increase resource requirements for <b>CVD</b> preventive services in primary care. Moreover the true impact is likely to be underestimated given other adjustment factors related to diabetes risk that were not available in this dataset. Given the impact of these relatively small changes to the <b>CVD</b> risk calculator, locally developed and validated risk equations are urgently needed.
</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>26222883</td><td>Cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>) in Canadians with haemophilia: Age-Related <b>CVD</b> in Haemophilia Epidemiological Research (ARCHER study).</td><td>INTRODUCTION:
Improvements in haemophilia care have increased life expectancy in persons with haemophilia (PWH). This ageing population presents clinicians with management challenges as they develop age-related comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>).
AIMS:
To assess the epidemiology of <b>CVD</b> risk factors and events in an ageing Canadian haemophilia population.
METHODS:
A retrospective, multicentre chart review was carried out at five Canadian Hemophilia Treatment Centres. PWH (A and B) ≥35 years old were included and data were extracted on <b>CVD</b> risk factors and events.
RESULTS:
Data from 294 patients' charts were analysed including 222 (75.5%) patients with haemophilia A and 72 (24.5%) patients with haemophilia B with a median age at end of follow-up of 54 years (range = 36-90). Mean follow-up duration was 5.86 years. Cardiovascular risk factors were common: hypertension 31.3% (n = 90), diabetes mellitus 10.5% (n = 29), smoking 21.8% (n = 61), obesity 27.6% (n = 69), dyslipidaemia 22.4% (n = 65), family history 8.5% (n = 24), antiretroviral therapy 12.2% (n = 36). There were 24 <b>CVD</b> events (8.2% of the population) with a median age at event of 63 years (range = 46-83). Events consisted of coronary artery disease (CAD), 14; cerebrovascular disease, 4; and atrial fibrillation, 7. CAD was treated with coronary artery bypass grafting in three patients and percutaneous coronary intervention in nine patients. <b>CVD</b> events were complicated by six bleeding events (three minor and three major).
CONCLUSION:
Cardiovascular disease risk factors and events are relatively common in PWH. PWH can be safely treated for <b>CVD</b> events with similar procedures as the non-PWH populations, though specific clotting factor prophylaxis protocols are not well defined.
</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>18637168</td><td>The impact of individualised cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>) risk estimates and lifestyle advice on physical activity in individuals at high risk of <b>CVD</b>: a pilot 2 x 2 factorial understanding risk trial.</td><td>BACKGROUND:
There is currently much interest in encouraging individuals to increase physical activity in order to reduce <b>CVD</b> risk. This study has been designed to determine if personalised <b>CVD</b> risk appreciation can increase physical activity in adults at high risk of <b>CVD</b>.
METHODSDESIGN:
In a 2 x 2 factorial design participants are allocated at random to a personalised 10-year <b>CVD</b> risk estimate or numerical <b>CVD</b> risk factor values (systolic blood pressure, LDL cholesterol and fasting glucose) and, simultaneously, to receive a brief lifestyle advice intervention targeting physical activity, diet and smoking cessation or not. We aim to recruit 200 participants from Oxfordshire primary care practices. Eligibility criteria include adults age 40-70 years, estimated 10-year <b>CVD</b> risk  or =20%, ability to read and write English, no known <b>CVD</b> and no physical disability or other condition reducing the ability to walk. Primary outcome is physical activity measured by ActiGraph accelerometer with biochemical, anthropometrical and psychological measures as additional outcomes. Primary analysis is between group physical activity differences at one month powered to detect a difference of 30,000 total counts per day of physical activity between the groups. Additional analyses will seek to further elucidate the relationship between the provision of risk information, and intention to change behaviour and to determine the impact of both interventions on clinical and anthropometrical measures including fasting and 2 hour plasma glucose, fructosamine, serum cotinine, plasma vitamin C, body fat percentage and blood pressure.
DISCUSSION:
This is a pilot trial seeking to demonstrate in a real world setting, proof of principal that provision of personalised risk information can contribute to behaviour changes aimed at reducing <b>CVD</b> risk. This study will increase our understanding of the links between the provision of risk information and behaviour change and if successful, could be used in clinical practice with little or no modification.
</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>28964324</td><td>Coffee consumption is not associated with prevalent subclinical cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>) or the risk of <b>CVD</b> events, in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: results from the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis.</td><td>BACKGROUND:
Atherosclerosis and its clinical sequelae represent the leading cause of mortality among patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). While epidemiologic data support the hepatoprotective benefits of coffee in NAFLD, whether coffee improves NAFLD-associated <b>CVD</b> risk is unknown.
METHODS:
We examined 3710 ethnically-diverse participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) cohort, without history of known liver disease, and with available coffee data from a validated 120-item food frequency questionnaire. All participants underwent baseline non-contrast cardiac CT from which NAFLD was defined by liver:spleen ratio (L:S<1.0), and subclinical CVD was defined by coronary artery calcium (CAC)>0. Major <b>CVD</b> events were defined by the first occurrence of myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, angina, stroke, or <b>CVD</b> death. We used log-binomial regression to calculate the adjusted prevalence ratio (PR) for CAC0 by coffee intake and NAFLD status, and events were compared between groups using frequency of events within adjusted Cox proportional hazard regression models.
RESULTS:
Seventeen percent (N=637) of participants met criteria for NAFLD. NAFLD participants were more likely to have elevated BMI (mean 31.1±5.5kgm2 vs. 28.0±5.2kgm2, p<0.0001), and diabetes (22% vs. 11%, p<0.0001), but did not differ in daily coffee consumption (p=0.97). Among NAFLD participants, coffee consumption was not associated with prevalent, baseline CAC>0 (PR=1.02 [0.98-1.07]). Over 12.8years of follow-up, 93 NAFLD and 415 non-NAFLD participants experienced a CV event. However, coffee intake was not associated with incident <b>CVD</b> events, in either NAFLD (HR=1.05 [0.91-1.21]) or non-NAFLD participants (HR=1.03 [0.97-1.11]).
CONCLUSION:
In a large, population-based cohort, coffee consumption was not associated with the prevalence of subclinical <b>CVD</b>, nor did coffee impact the future risk of major <b>CVD</b> events, regardless of underlying NAFLD status.
</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>18788391</td><td>[Chronic kidney disease (CKD) as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>)].</td><td>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been shown to be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>) in a number of recent epidemiological studies. There are possible explanations for the independent association of CKD with <b>CVD</b>. Reduced renal function is associated with a high prevalence of traditional <b>CVD</b> risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and left ventricular hypertrophy. In addition, reduced renal function may be associated with increased levels of nontraditional risk factors, such as inflammation and oxidative stress. Subjects with CKD should be considered a high-risk population for <b>CVD</b> and be recommended for more intensive preventive management of <b>CVD</b>, including active detection and strict treatment of <b>CVD</b> risk factors.</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>20392507</td><td>All-cause and <b>CVD</b> mortality in Native Hawaiians.</td><td>AIMS:
Cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>) is the leading cause of death among Native Hawaiians. In this article, all-cause and cardiovascular mortality rates among Native Hawaiians are examined, along with associated <b>CVD</b> risk factors.
METHODS:
A total of 855 Native Hawaiians (343 men and 512 women, ages 19-88) were examined as participants of the Cardiovascular Risk Clinics program (1992-1998) and underwent surveillance through September 2007. Cause of each death was determined by review of medical records, death certificates, newspapers, and through queries to community members.
RESULTS:
<b>CVD</b> accounted for 55% of deaths. Coronary heart disease (CHD) accounted for the majority of <b>CVD</b> deaths. <b>CVD</b> increased with age and was higher in those with diabetes, hypertension, or high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). <b>CVD</b> rates were higher in men than in women and fourfold higher in those with diabetes. In addition to age, diabetes, hypertension, and elevated LDL-C were major risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS:
Diabetes is a major determinant of <b>CVD</b> in this population and most of the <b>CVD</b> is occurring in those with diabetes. Strategies to prevent diabetes and manage blood pressure and lipids should reduce <b>CVD</b> rates in Native Hawaiians.

To assess the prevalence of undiagnosed cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>) in a cohort of male steelworkers in South Wales, UK.
METHODS:
Male steel industry workers (n = 221) with no prior diagnosis of <b>CVD</b> or diabetes accepted a <b>CVD</b> risk assessment within the work environment. Demographic, anthropometric, family, and medical histories were all recorded and capillary blood samples obtained. The 10-year <b>CVD</b> risk was predicted using the QRISK2-2012 algorithm.
RESULTS:
Up to 81.5% of workers were either overweight or obese. More than 20% of workers were found to have diastolic hypertension, high total cholesterol, andor a total cholesterolhigh-density lipoprotein ratio of six or more. Over one quarter of workers assessed had an increased 10-year <b>CVD</b> risk.
CONCLUSIONS:
Despite a physically demanding occupation, risk assessment in the workplace uncovered significant occult factors in <b>CVD</b> risk in a sample of male heavy industry workers.
</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>16621114</td><td>Microalbuminuria presents the same vascular risk as overt <b>CVD</b> in type 2 diabetes.</td><td>OBJECTIVES:
We attempted to assess whether microalbuminuria conferred the same cardiovascular risk as overt <b>CVD</b> in type 2 diabetic patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS:
A prospective cohort study including 436 type 2 diabetic patients (64.8+-9.2 years old) without proteinuria, with follow-up until any cardiovascular event occurred, was performed. Patients were classified into four groups: group 0, non baseline <b>CVD</b> and normoalbuminuria; group 1, non baseline <b>CVD</b> and microalbuminuria; group 2, baseline <b>CVD</b> and normoalbuminuria; group 3, baseline <b>CVD</b> and microalbuminuria. Cox's multivariate regression models were used to assess the risk ratio (RR) associated with each variable.
RESULTS:
The median follow-up time was 7.6 years. Incidence rates of cardiovascular events per 1000 patient-years increased from groups 0 to 3 (23.8, 63.4, 74.1, 85.6; p0.0001). Multivariate RR for incident <b>CVD</b> in groups 1, 2 and 3 in relation to group 0 were 2.8 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7-4.6; p0.0001), 2.7 (95% CI 1.6-4.6; p0.0001) and 2.9 (95% CI 1.6-5.4; p=0.001), respectively. No significant differences were seen between groups 1 and 2.
CONCLUSIONS:
We suggest that patients with microalbuminuria are at very high vascular risk and should share the same objectives of a vascular risk-factor control as patients with overt <b>CVD</b>.

To examine the performance of 'the Framingham's general <b>CVD</b> algorithm' in estimating 5-year risk of cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>) and coronary heart disease (CHD) in an adult Middle Eastern community.
METHODS:
In a population-based prospective cohort, the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS), <b>CVD</b> risk estimates were calculated for 3838 individuals (2183 women) free of <b>CVD</b> at baseline.
RESULTS:
Over 8.6 years, there were 119 <b>CVD</b> (106 CHD) events among women, and 164 (137) among men aged ≥ 30 years. Standard risk factors [age, systolic blood pressure (SBP), antihypertensive treatment, total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking and diabetes mellitus], measured at baseline, were significantly related to the incidence of <b>CVD</b>. The only exception, lack of significance for coefficients of SBP among women, was attributable to collinearity between age and SBP. For most risk factors, hazard ratios (HRs) for <b>CVD</b> were similar for the TLGS and the Framingham cohorts' participants. Few exceptions were lower HR for SBP among TLGS' women and lower HR for age among TLGS' men. The Framingham equations quite correctly discriminated participants [C statistic: <b>CVD</b>, 0.818 (women) and 0.774 (men); CHD: 0.822 (women) and 0.751 (men)] with good calibration (all calibration χ(2) values  15, ps  0.1).
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS:
The Framingham's <b>CVD</b> algorithm was effective at ranking individuals and could be used to quantify risk and to guide preventive care in Iranian adults. For regions without established cohort, recalibration using risk factors and <b>CVD</b> (CHD) rates may be an effective method to develop <b>CVD</b> (CHD) risk prediction algorithms for local practice.

To describe the cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>) risk factor status of approximately 18,000 patients profiled in routine primary care practice by PREDICT-<b>CVD</b>, a web-based clinical decision support program for assessing and managing <b>CVD</b> risk.
METHODS:
Between 2002 and 2005, 31,241 <b>CVD</b> risk assessments of 18,260 patients were undertaken in ProCare, a large primary care organisation in Auckland.
RESULTS:
Baseline risk assessments were completed for 10,374 (57%) men and 7886 (43%) women. The mean age was 56 years (range 17 to 94 years), Of those assessed, 11% were of Pacific and 7% of Maori ethnicity. Risk assessment was more likely in men under the age of 65 years. In the over 65 year age group, women were more likely to be risk assessed. The overall prevalence of diabetes and smoking in this cohort was 14% and 13% respectively. A history of a previous <b>CVD</b> event increased with age in both men and women. Above the age of 75 years, 36% reported a previous cardiovascular event, most commonly ischaemic heart disease. The patients assessed represented 6% of men and 4% of women in the enrolled ProCare population over 35 years of age.
CONCLUSIONS:
General practitioners and practice nurses using PREDICT-<b>CVD</b> targeted patients according to national guideline age and gender recommendations. PREDICT-<b>CVD</b> is a practical and effective tool for systematically generating standardised patient <b>CVD</b> risk factor profiles during routine primary care practice. When implemented widely, PREDICT will enable primary care organisations to monitor the <b>CVD</b> risk burden and management in their practice populations using a nationally standardised evidence-based approach.

While cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>) mortality has been declining recently, this global epidemic of diabetes threatens to stall this trend. <b>CVD</b> is the leading cause of death in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, with at least a two- to fourfold increased risk in patients with diabetes. In this review, the risk factors for <b>CVD</b> are discussed in the context of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. While traditional risk factors such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, and obesity are greater in type 2 patients than in type 1 diabetes, they explain only about half of the increased <b>CVD</b> risk. The role for diabetes-specific risk factors, including hyperglycemia and kidney complications, is discussed in the context of new study findings.</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>28625949</td><td>Discussion on the risk factors of developing cardiovascular diseases (<b>CVD</b>) after the kidney transplantation.</td><td>To discuss the risk factors of developing cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>) after the kidney transplantation. Retrospective analysis on the data of 1106 patients who had been underwent kidney allotransplantation in People's Hospital of Zhengzhou from July, 2010 to Dec, 2014 and conformed to the inclusion criteria was taken. Cox proportional hazard model was used to analyze the risk factors of developing <b>CVD</b> after the kidney transplantation. 7 days, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months before and after the operation, the data collection and following-up visits were respectively arranged. 12 months after the operation, the following-up visits were arranged once a half year until the end of March, 2014. 216 (19.5%) patients developed <b>CVD</b> after the kidney transplantation. Among them, 47 (4.2%) patients developed <b>CVD</b> within the first three months after the operation, which accounted for 26.8% in the <b>CVD</b> patients; 125 (11.3%) patients developed <b>CVD</b> within the first one year after the operation, which accounted for 47.9% in the <b>CVD</b> patients. 51 (4.6%) patients died after the operation. Among them, 19 (2.7%) patients died of <b>CVD</b>, which accounted for 37.3% in the whole died patients. Multiple factors analysis revealed that the following were the risk factors to develop <b>CVD</b> after the kidney transplantation: The age of receptors was greater than 50 (OR=2.39, 95%CI 1.15-3.60); The receptors had diabetes before the surgery (OR=3.18, 95%CI 1.56-6.42); The receptors had <b>CVD</b> medical history before the surgery (OR=3.85, 95%CI 2.15-7.54); The primary diseases of receptors were diabetic nephropathy (DN) (OR=2.12, 95%CI 1.14-3.98); The preoperative dialysis time was greater than 12 months(OR=1.27, 95%CI 0.98-1.38); The postoperative serum creatinine of the receptors was greater than 200 μmolL (OR=2.78, 95%CI 1.35~4.53); The delayed graft failure (DGF) occurred (OR=1.24, 95%CI 1.02~1.42); Acute rejection appeared(AR)(OR=2.98, 95%CI 1.56~5.72); Renal allograft dysfunction appeared (OR=4.86, 95%CI 3.15~7.78). The morbidity of <b>CVD</b> is high after the kidney transplantation and the risk factors are diversified. That revising or excluding relevant risk factors may lower the morbidity of developing <b>CVD</b> and is in favor of the long-term survival for the transplanted kidney.</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>16879779</td><td>The metabolic syndrome and endothelial dysfunction: common highway to type 2 diabetes and <b>CVD</b>.</td><td>Due to global lifestyle changes, obesity (the main driver of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease ) is reaching pandemic proportions.

This cross-sectional study, covering a 5-year period, included PWH aged ≥35 years who were cared for at a single haemophilia treatment centre in the United States. Medical records were extensively reviewed to collect the information about <b>CVD</b> events and their risk factors such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia and smoking. Prevalence rates were compared with national population estimates and associations between risk factors and <b>CVD</b> events were examined using logistic regression. The study cohort comprised 185 PWH (102 haemophilia A and 83 haemophilia B). Lifetime prevalence of a <b>CVD</b> event was 19.5% (36185, 95% confidence interval [CI] 13.8-25.2%). <b>CVD</b> mortality was 5.4% (10185, 95% CI 2.7-8.1). Compared with US non-Hispanic White males (NHWH), PWH had about twice the prevalence of coronary artery disease, stroke and myocardial infarction. The prevalence of <b>CVD</b> risk factors for PWH was similar to that for US NHWM with 39.5% of PWH exposed to two or more of these risk factors. Both hypertension and smoking were associated significantly with <b>CVD</b> events, with odds ratios of 4.9 and 6.3, respectively. In conclusion, this study revealed that both <b>CVD</b> events and its risk factors were at least equally prevalent among PWH and might have been even higher than among the US NHWM in the United States.

Interleukin-18 (IL-18), a proinflammatory cytokine, plays a key role in the acute and chronic inflammatory processes. It is associated with risk of developing cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>). The aim of this study was to evaluate association between G(-137)C polymorphism (rs187238) in the IL-18 gene and risk of diabetes and <b>CVD</b> in type 2 diabetes patients.
METHODS:
We examined 1548 T2DM patients and 590 controls. All subjects were genotyped for the G(-137)C promoter region polymorphism by polymerase chain reaction (PCR-SSP).
RESULTS:
Genotype distribution of the G(-137)C polymorphism showed no significant difference between T2DM patients and controls (p=0.115). An association with <b>CVD</b> was analyzed in two age groups: ⩾65 and 65years. In patients younger than 65years there was a tendency to association of CC genotype with CAD (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.0-3, p=0.051). In contrast, in subjects aged 65 or older, the C allele and CC genotype showed the significant association with the presence of <b>CVD</b>, with the OR 1.99, p=0.001 and OR 5.31, p=0.006, respectively. The C allele carriers showed the higher prevalence of <b>CVD</b> compared to non-carriers (61% vs. 39%, p0.0001).
CONCLUSION:
Older T2DM patients carrying the C allele of IL-18 G(-137)C polymorphism have a significantly increased risk of <b>CVD</b>.

Many traditional risk factors such as age, male sex, hypertension, dyslipidemia, glycemic control, diabetes duration, renal dysfunction, obesity, and smoking have been studied and identified as independent factors for <b>CVD</b>. Quantifying the risk of <b>CVD</b> among diabetics using the common risk factors in order to plan the treatment and preventive measures is important in the management of these patients as recommended by many clinical guidelines. Therefore, several risk assessment tools have been developed in different parts of the world for this purpose. These include the tools that have been developed for general populations and considered T2DM as a risk factor, and the tools that have been developed for T2DM populations specifically. However, due to the differences in sociodemographic factors and lifestyle patterns, as well as the differences in the distribution of various <b>CVD</b> risk factors in different diabetic populations, the external applicability of these tools on different populations is questionable. This review aims to address the applicability of the existing <b>CVD</b> risk models to the Omani diabetic population.</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>25397456</td><td>CD4CD8 ratio is not predictive of multi-morbidity prevalence in HIV-infected patients but identify patients with higher <b>CVD</b> risk.</td><td>BACKGROUND:
CD4CD8<0.8 is a surrogate marker of immune-activation/immunosenescence and independently predicts mortality in the HIV-infected patients due to non-AIDS related events. Most studies showed that patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) often fail to normalize the CD4/CD8 ratio despite CD4 count normalization. Primary objective of the study was to explore the impact of CD4/CD8<0.8 as independent predictor of HIV-associated non-AIDS (HANA) conditions and multimorbidity (MM) in HIV patients. In patients with no previous history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) a particular insight is provided in the association between impact of CD4/CD8<0.8 and risk prediction of CVD or radiological markers of subclinical CVD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
914 consecutive patients attending Modena Metabolic HIV Clinic were evaluated in a cross-sectional retrospective study.
INCLUSION CRITERIA:
stable ART from ≥2 years; HIV-RNA plasma levels<40 copies/mL; stable CD4 count≥350/mmc. CD4/CD8 strata (0.8) was chosen as a cut off representing the median value of the cohort. MM was defined as the presence of≥2 HANA conditions including standard defined: chronic kidney disease, hypertension, previous CVD events, osteoporosis and diabetes mellitus. Calendar year of ART initiation was defined: "PreART" (<2000); "EarlyART" (2000-2005) and "LateART" (>=2006). High <b>CVD</b> risk was defined for Framingham Risk Score (FRS)≥6. Subclinical <b>CVD</b> was defined using cardiac CT scan for calcium score (CAC)≥100. Logistic univariate and multivariable adjusted analysis were performed to assess relationships between variables.
RESULTS:
Demographic and HIV-specific variables distribution in patients with and without MM are shown in Table 1.
CONCLUSIONS:
Low CD4CD8 ratio was not associated with MM prevalence. Patients with CD4CD80.8 ratio displayed higher prevalence of <b>CVD</b>. At multivariable logistic regression CD4CD80.8 is an independent prepredictor of enhanced <b>CVD</b> risk. This may support role of immune-activationsenescence in the pathogenesis of <b>CVD</b>.

Multiple risk factors contribute to <b>CVD</b>. Elevated LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglyceride levels, low HDL-cholesterol levels, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and smoking are key modifiable risk factors. Such risk factors are present in 80-90% of coronary heart disease (CHD) patients. For many factors, modification can significantly reduce <b>CVD</b> incidence. For example, statin-induced LDL-C reductions reduce cardiovascular events by 24-37% and smoking cessation reduces CHD mortality by 36%. The need to identify and treat these risk factors has led many national and local groups to develop clinical practice guidelines for management of <b>CVD</b>. Although the aim of such guidelines is to provide practitioners with a framework to identify, prioritize, and manage patients, the plethora of guidelines can cause confusion. In addition, research indicates that guidelines are not being optimally implemented. This review considers these practical issues, highlights the common goals shared by many guidelines, and focuses on how these can be best achieved.

Co-morbid major depressive disorder (MDD) and cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>) is associated with poor clinical and psychological outcomes. However, the full extent of the burden of, and interaction between, this co-morbidity on important vocational outcomes remains less clear, particularly at the population level. We examine the association of co-morbid MDD with work outcomes in persons with and without <b>CVD</b>.
METHODS:
This study utilised cross-sectional, population-based data from the 2007 Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing (n = 8841) to compare work outcomes of individuals with diagnostically-defined MDD and <b>CVD</b>, MDD but not <b>CVD</b>, <b>CVD</b> but not MDD, with a reference group of "healthy" Australians. Workforce participation was defined as being in full- or part-time employment. Work functioning was measured using a WHO Disability Assessment Schedule item. Absenteeism was assessed using the 'days out of role' item.
RESULTS:
Of the four groups, those with co-morbid MDD and <b>CVD</b> were least likely to report workforce participation (adj OR:0.4, 95% CI: 0.3-0.6). Those with MDD only (adj OR:0.8, 95% CI:0.7-0.9) and <b>CVD</b> only (adj OR:0.8, 95% CI: 0.6-0.9) also reported significantly reduced odds of participation. Employed individuals with co-morbid MDD and <b>CVD</b> were 8 times as likely to experience impairments in work functioning (adj OR:8.1, 95% CI: 3.8- 17.3) compared with the reference group. MDD was associated with a four-fold increase in impaired functioning. Further, individuals with co-morbid MDD and <b>CVD</b> reported greatest likelihood of workplace absenteeism (adj. OR:3.0, 95% CI: 1.4-6.6). Simultaneous exposure to MDD and <b>CVD</b> conferred an even greater likelihood of poorer work functioning.
CONCLUSIONS:
Co-morbid MDD and <b>CVD</b> is associated with significantly poorer work outcomes. Specifically, the effects of these conditions on work functioning are synergistic. The development of specialised treatment programs for those with co-morbid MDD and <b>CVD</b> is required.
</td></tr><tr><td>28</td><td>22318928</td><td>A pilot study evaluating multiple risk factor interventions by community pharmacists to prevent cardiovascular disease: the PAART <b>CVD</b> pilot project.</td><td>BACKGROUND:
There is insufficient evidence for the efficacy of comprehensive multiple risk factor interventions by pharmacists in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>). Given the proven benefits of pharmacist interventions for individual risk factors, it is essential that evidence for a comprehensive approach to care be generated so that pharmacists remain key members of the health care team for individuals at risk of initial onset of <b>CVD</b>.
OBJECTIVE:
To establish the feasibility of an intervention delivered by community pharmacists to reduce the risk of primary onset of <b>CVD</b>.
METHODS:
A single-cohort intervention study was undertaken in 2008-2009. Twelve community pharmacists from 10 pharmacies who were trained to provide lifestyle and medicine management support to reduce <b>CVD</b> risk recruited 70 at-risk participants aged 50-74 years who were free from diabetes or <b>CVD</b>. Participants received a baseline assessment to establish <b>CVD</b> risk and health behaviors. An assessment report provided to patients and pharmacists was used to collaboratively establish treatment goals and, over 5 sessions, implement treatment strategies. Follow-up assessment at 6 months measured changes in baseline parameters. The primary outcome was the average change to overall 5-year risk of <b>CVD</b> onset.
RESULTS:
Sixty-seven participants were included in the analysis. The mean participant age was 60 years and 73% were female. We observed a 25% (95% CI 17 to 33) proportional risk reduction in overall <b>CVD</b> risk. Significant reductions also occurred in mean blood pressure (-11-5 mm Hg) and waist circumference (-1.3 cm), with trends toward improvement for most other observed risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS:
Findings support previous evidence of positive cardiovascular health outcomes following pharmacist intervention in other patient groups; we recommend generating randomized controlled trial evidence for a primary prevention population.

To compare the cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>) risk profiles of Indian and European patients from routine primary care assessments in the northern region of New Zealand.
METHOD:
Anonymous <b>CVD</b> risk profiles were extracted from PREDICT (a web-based decision support program) for Indian and European patients aged 35-74 years. Linear regression models were used to obtain mean differences adjusted for age, gender and deprivation.
RESULTS:
At recruitment, Indian participants (n=8,830) were younger than Europeans (n=47,091), in keeping with national guidelines that recommend earlier <b>CVD</b> risk assessment for Indians. Compared with Europeans, a greater proportion of Indian participants lived in areas of higher deprivation and had a two to four-fold greater burden of diabetes in all age groups. Indian participants had a significantly lower proportion of smokers and a lower mean systolic blood pressure. The respective cardiovascular risk factor profiles lead to similar age-adjusted Framingham five-year <b>CVD</b> risk scores.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS:
National data sources indicate that there are higher rates of hospitalisations and deaths from <b>CVD</b> in Indians compared with Europeans. Our study found similar predicted <b>CVD</b> risk in these two populations despite markedly different clustering of risk factors, suggesting that the Framingham risk equation may underestimate risk in Indians.

To examine relationships between body mass index (BMI), prevalence of physician-recorded cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>) risk factors in primary care, and changes in risk with 10% weight change.
METHODS:
The Counterweight Project conducted a baseline cross-sectional survey of medical records of 6150 obese (BMI ≥ 30 kgm(2)), 1150 age- and sex-matched overweight (BMI 25 to 30 kgm(2)), and 1150 age- and sex-matched normal weight (BMI 18.5 to 25 kgm(2)) controls, in primary care. Data were collected for the previous 18 months to examine BMI and disease prevalence, and then modelled to show the potential effect of 10% weight loss or gain on risk.
RESULTS:
Obese patients develop more <b>CVD</b> risk factors than normal weight controls. BMI ≥ 40 kgm(2) exhibits increased prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), odds ratio (OR) men: 6.16 (p  0.001); women: 7.82 (p  0.001) and hypertension OR men: 5.51 (p  0.001); women: 4.16 (p  0.001). Dyslipidaemia peaked around BMI 35 to 37.5 kgm(2), OR men: 3.26 (p  0.001); women 3.76 (p  0.001) and <b>CVD</b> at BMI 37.5 to 40 kgm(2) in men, OR 4.48 (p  0.001) and BMI ≥ 40 kgm(2) in women, OR 3.98 (p  0.001). A 10% weight loss from the sample mean of 32.5 kgm(2) reduced the OR for type 2 DM by 30% and <b>CVD</b> by 20%, while 10% weight gain increased type 2 DM risk by more than 35% and <b>CVD</b> by 20%.
CONCLUSION:
Obesity plays a fundamental role in <b>CVD</b> risk, which is reduced with weight loss. Weight management intervention strategies should be a public health priority to reduce the burden of disease in the population.

CMS recently added medication adherence to antihypertensives, antihyperlipidemics, and oral antihyperglycemics to its Medicare Star quality measures. These CMS metrics exclude patients with 2 medication fills (ie, "early nonadherence") and patients concurrently taking insulin. This study examined the proportion of patients with diabetes prescribed cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>) medications excluded from Star adherence metrics and assessed the relationship of both Star-defined adherence and exclusion from Star metrics with <b>CVD</b> risk factor control.
STUDY DESIGN:
Cross-sectional, population-based analysis of 129,040 patients with diabetes aged ≥65 years in 2010 from 3 Kaiser Permanente regions.
METHODS:
We estimated adjusted risk ratios to assess the relationship between achieving Star adherence and being excluded from Star adherence metrics, with <b>CVD</b> risk factor control (glycated hemoglobin [A1C]8.0%, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C]100 mgdL, and systolic blood pressure [SBP]130 mm Hg) in patients with diabetes.
RESULTS:
Star metrics excluded 27% of patients with diabetes prescribed oral medications. Star-defined nonadherence was negatively associated with <b>CVD</b> risk factor control (risk ratio [RR], 0.95, 0.84, 0.96 for A1C, LDL-C, and SBP control, respectively; P.001). Exclusion from Star metrics due to early nonadherence was also strongly associated with poor control (RR, 0.83, 0.56, 0.87 for A1C, LDL-C, and SBP control, respectively; P.001). Exclusion for insulin use was negatively associated with A1C control (RR, 0.78; P.0001).
CONCLUSIONS:
Medicare Star adherence measures underestimate the prevalence of medication nonadherence in diabetes and exclude patients at high risk for poor <b>CVD</b> outcomes. Up to 3 million elderly patients with diabetes may be excluded from these measures nationally. Quality measures designed to encourage effective medication use should focus on all patients treated for <b>CVD</b> risk.

Kidney function, expressed as glomerular filtration rate (GFR), is commonly estimated from serum creatinine (Scr) and, when decreased, may serve as a nonclassical risk factor for incident cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>). The ability of estimated GFR (eGFR) to predict <b>CVD</b> events during 5-10 years of follow-up is assessed using data from the Strong Heart Study (SHS), a large cohort with a high prevalence of diabetes.
METHODS:
eGFRs were calculated with the abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study (MDRD) and the Cockcroft-Gault (CG) equations. These estimates were compared in participants with normal and abnormal Scr. The association between eGFR and incident <b>CVD</b> was assessed.
RESULTS:
More subjects were labeled as having low eGFR (60 mlmin per 1.73 m2) by the MDRD or CG equation, than by Scr alone. When Scr was in the normal range, both equations labeled similar numbers of participants as having low eGFRs, although concordance between the equations was poor. However, when Scr was elevated, the MDRD equation labeled more subjects as having low eGFR. Persons with low eGFR had increased risk of <b>CVD</b>.
CONCLUSIONS:
The MDRD and CG equations labeled more participants as having decreased GFR than did Scr alone. Decreased eGFR was predictive of <b>CVD</b> in this American Indian population with a high prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
</td></tr><tr><td>38</td><td>23239597</td><td>Elevated remnant lipoproteins may increase subclinical <b>CVD</b> risk in pre-pubertal children with obesity: a case-control study.</td><td>OBJECTIVES:
Current clinical guidelines to assess paediatric cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>) risk heavily rely on cholesterol parameters that are generally normal for obese children. Remnant lipoproteins have emerged as a critical <b>CVD</b> risk factor particularly in adults with normolipidemia. We assessed remnant lipoprotein concentration (measured by apolipoprotein [apo] B48) and its relationship with other traditional <b>CVD</b> risk biomarkers in pre-pubertal children with obesity.
METHODS:
Pre-pubertal children (n = 78) with obesity (n = 39, 9.9 ± 0.3 years old) as well as sex-matched normal-weight controls (n = 39, 9.8 ± 0.3 years) were assessed for anthropometry, blood pressure and fasting plasma biochemical parameters for remnant lipoprotein, lipid and glucoseinsulin metabolism, and inflammatory status.
RESULTS:
Children with obesity had striking 2-fold higher apoB48-containing remnant lipoproteins concentrations relative to normal-weight peers; the magnitude of elevation in the remnant lipoproteins is comparable to the levels previously reported for adults with established <b>CVD</b> and type-2 diabetes. Fasting apoB48 was positively correlated with fasting triglyceride concentration in children with obesity (r = 0.51, P  0.001) and their normal-weight peers (r = 0.45, P  0.01). Traditional <b>CVD</b> biomarkers including low-density lipoprotein cholesterol showed no difference between groups and remained within the normal range for a paediatric population.
CONCLUSION:
Elevated apoB48-containing remnant lipoprotein is a stronger biomarker for paediatric <b>CVD</b> risk compared to traditional cholesterol parameters and may be associated with early adaptation of the intestine during obesity. Further investigation of abnormalities associated with the secretion andor clearance of atherogenic remnant lipoproteins during the postprandial state may yield insight into our understanding of and therapeutic targets for managing risk for <b>CVD</b> in children with obesity.

BACKGROUND:
MetS and DM are associated with increased <b>CVD</b> risk, but it is unclear in these groups whether subclinical <b>CVD</b> as shown by increased LV mass improves risk prediction compared to standard risk factors in older individuals.
METHODS:
We studied 3,724 adults (mean 72.4 ± 5.4 years of age, 61.0% female, 4.4% African-American) from the Cardiovascular Health Study who had MetS but not DM or had DM alone or had neither condition.

After adjustment for age, sex and standard risk factors, LV mass was positively associated with <b>CVD</b> events in those with MetS (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.4, p  0.001) and without MetS (HR: 1.4, p  0.001), but not DM (HR: 1.0, p = 0.62), with similar findings for LV mass indexed for height or BSA. Adding LV mass to standard risk factors moderately improved the prediction accuracy in the overall sample and MetS group from changes in C-statistics (p  0.05). Categorical-free net reclassification improvement increased significantly by 17% to 19% in those with MetS. Findings were comparable for CHD, <b>CVD</b> mortality, and total mortality.
CONCLUSIONS:
LV mass is associated with increased <b>CVD</b> risk and provides modest added prediction and clinical utility compared to standard risk factors in older persons with and without MetS but not with DM.
</td></tr><tr><td>40</td><td>21629241</td><td>Epidemiology of <b>CVD</b> in rheumatic disease, with a focus on RA and SLE.</td><td>The excess risk of cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>) associated with inflammatory rheumatic diseases has long been recognized. Patients with established rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have higher mortality compared with the general population. Over 50% of premature deaths in RA are attributable to <b>CVD</b>. Excess mortality in SLE follows a bimodal pattern, with the early peak predominantly a consequence of active lupus or its complications, and the later peak largely attributable to atherosclerosis. Patients with RA or SLE are also at increased risk of nonfatal ischemic heart disease. The management and outcome of myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure in patients with RA or SLE differs from that in the general population. Traditional <b>CVD</b> risk factors (TRF) include increasing age, male gender, smoking, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and diabetes. Whereas some TRFs are elevated in patients with RA or SLE, several are not, and others exhibit paradoxical relationships. Risk scores developed for the general population based on TRFs are likely, therefore, to underestimate <b>CVD</b> risk in RA and SLE. Until additional research and disease-specific risk prediction tools are available, current evidence supports aggressive treatment of disease activity, and careful screening for and management of TRFs.</td></tr><tr><td>41</td><td>23805252</td><td>Excess Cardiovascular Risk Burden in Jamaican Women Does Not Influence Predicted 10-Year <b>CVD</b> Risk Profiles of Jamaica Adults: An Analysis of the 200708 Jamaica Health and Lifestyle Survey.</td><td>BACKGROUND:
Black Caribbean women have a higher burden of cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>) risk factors than their male counterparts. Whether this results in a difference in incident cardiovascular events is unknown. The aim of this study was to estimate the 10 year World Health OrganizationInternational Society for Hypertension (WHOISH) <b>CVD</b> risk score for Jamaica and explore the effect of sex as well as obesity, physical activity and socioeconomic status on these estimates.
METHODS AND FINDINGS:
Data from 40-74 year old participants in the 200708 Jamaica Health and Lifestyle Survey were used. Trained interviewers administered questionnaires and measured anthropometrics, blood pressure, fasting glucose and cholesterol. Education and occupation were used to assess socioeconomic status. The Americas B tables were used to estimate the WHOISH 10 year <b>CVD</b> risk scores for the population. Weighted prevalence estimates were calculated. Data from 1,432 (450 men, 982 women) participants were analysed, after excluding those with self-reported heart attack and stroke. The women had a higher prevalence of diabetes (19%W;12%M), hypertension (49%W;47%M), hypercholesterolemia (25%W;11%M), obesity (46%W;15%M) and physical inactivity (59%W;29%M). More men smoked (6%W;31%M). There was good agreement between the 10-year cardiovascular risk estimates whether or not cholesterol measurements were utilized for calculation (kappa -0.61). While 90% had a 10 year WHOISH <b>CVD</b> risk of less than 10%, approximately 2% of the population or 14,000 persons had a 10 year WHOISH <b>CVD</b> risk of ≥30%. As expected <b>CVD</b> risk increased with age but there was no sex difference in <b>CVD</b> risk distribution despite women having a greater risk factor burden. Women with low socioeconomic status had the most adverse <b>CVD</b> risk profile.
CONCLUSION:
Despite women having a higher prevalence of <b>CVD</b> risk factors there was no sex difference in 10-year WHOISH <b>CVD</b> risk in Jamaican adults.

Previous research among American Indians of the strong heart family study (SHFS) has demonstrated significant heritabilities for <b>CVD</b> risk factors and implicated diabetes as an important predictor of several of the phenotypes. Moreover, we recently demonstrated that genetic effects on <b>CVD</b> risk factors differed in diabetic and nondiabetic individuals. In this paper, we investigated whether a significant genetic influence on diabetes status could be identified, and whether there is evidence for joint action of genes on diabetes status and related <b>CVD</b> risk factors.
METHODS AND RESULTS:
Approximately 950 men and women, age 18 or older, in 32 extended families, were examined between 1997 and 1999. We estimated the effects of genes and environmental covariates on diabetes status using a threshold model and a maximum likelihood variance component approach. Diabetes status exhibited a residual heritability of 22% (h2=0.22). We also estimated the genetic and environmental correlations between diabetes susceptibility and eight risk factors for <b>CVD</b>. All eight <b>CVD</b> risk factors displayed significant genetic correlations with diabetes status (BMI (rhoG=0.55), fibrinogen (rhoG=0.40), HDL-C (rhoG=-0.37), ln triglycerides (rhoG=0.65), FAT (rhoG=0.38 ), PAI-1 (rhoG=0.67), SBP (rhoG=0.57), and WHR (rhoG=0.58)). Three of eight traits (HDL-C (rhoE=-0.32), ln triglycerides (rhoE=0.33), and fibrinogen (rhoE=0.20)) displayed significant environmental correlations with diabetes status.
CONCLUSIONS:
These findings suggest that in the context of a high prevalence of diabetes, still unidentified diabetes genes may play an important role in influencing variation in <b>CVD</b> risk factors.
</td></tr><tr><td>43</td><td>26486189</td><td>Associations Between Prediabetes, by Three Different Diagnostic Criteria, and Incident <b>CVD</b> Differ in South Asians and Europeans.</td><td>OBJECTIVE:
We examined longitudinal associations between prediabetes and cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>) (coronary heart disease [CHD] and stroke) in Europeans and South Asians.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS:
This was a U.K. cohort study of 1,336 Europeans and 1,139 South Asians, aged 40-69 years at baseline (1988-1991). Assessment included blood pressure, blood tests, anthropometry, and questionnaires. Prediabetes was determined by OGTT or HbA1c, using either International Expert Committee (IEC) (HbA1c 6.0-6.5% [42-48 mmolmol]) or American Diabetes Association (ADA) (HbA1c 5.7-6.5% [39-48 mmolmol]) cut points. Incident CHD and stroke were established at 20 years from death certification, hospital admission, primary care record review, and participant report.
RESULTS:
Compared with normoglycemic individuals, IEC-defined prediabetes was related to both CHD and <b>CVD</b> risk in Europeans but not South Asians (subhazard ratio for CHD 1.68 [95% CI 1.19, 2.38] vs. 1.00 [0.75, 1.33], ethnicity interaction P = 0.008, and for <b>CVD</b> 1.49 [1.08, 2.07] vs. 1.03 [0.78, 1.36], ethnicity interaction P = 0.04). Conversely, IEC-defined prediabetes was associated with stroke risk in South Asians but not Europeans (1.73 [1.03, 2.90] vs. 0.85 [0.44, 1.64], ethnicity interaction P = 0.11). Risks were adjusted for age, sex, smoking, total-to-HDL cholesterol ratio, waist-to-hip ratio, systolic blood pressure, and antihypertensive use. Associations were weaker for OGTT or ADA-defined prediabetes. Conversion from prediabetes to diabetes was greater in South Asians, but accounting for time to conversion did not account for these ethnic differences.
CONCLUSIONS:
Associations between prediabetes and <b>CVD</b> differed by prediabetes diagnostic criterion, type of <b>CVD</b>, and ethnicity, with associations being present for overall <b>CVD</b> in Europeans but not South Asians. Substantiation of these findings and investigation of potential explanations are required.
</td></tr><tr><td>44</td><td>25213709</td><td><b>CVD</b> risk factors are related to plasma fibrin clot properties independent of total and or γ' fibrinogen concentration.</td><td>INTRODUCTION:
Cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>) risk factors are associated with total fibrinogen concentration andor altered clot structure. It is however, unclear whether such associations with clot structure are ascribed to fibrinogen concentration or other independent mechanisms. We aimed to determine whether <b>CVD</b> risk factors associated with increased total andor γ' fibrinogen concentration, were also associated with altered fibrin clot properties and secondly whether such associations were due to the fibrinogen concentration or through independent associations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
In a plasma setting <b>CVD</b> risk factors (including total and γ' fibrinogen concentration) were cross-sectionally analysed in 2010 apparently healthy black South African participants. Kinetics of clot formation (lag time, slope and maximum absorbance) as well as clot lysis times were calculated from turbidity curves.
RESULTS:
Of the measured <b>CVD</b> risk factors age, metabolic syndrome, C-reactive protein (CRP), high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and homocysteine were significantly associated with altered fibrin clot properties after adjustment for total and or γ' fibrinogen concentration. Aging was associated with thicker fibres (p=0.004) while both metabolic syndrome and low HDL-cholesterol levels were associated with lower rates of lateral aggregation (slope), (p=0.0004 and p=0.0009), and the formation of thinner fibres (p=0.007 and p=0.0004). Elevated CRP was associated with increased rates of lateral aggregation (p=0.002) and consequently thicker fibres (p0.0001). Hyperhomocysteinemia was associated with increased rates of lateral aggregation (p=0.0007) without affecting fibre thickness.
CONCLUSION:
Final clot structure may contribute to increased <b>CVD</b> risk in vivo through associations with other <b>CVD</b> risk factors independent from total or γ' fibrinogen concentration.

Potential differences in cardiovascular risk by ethnicity remain uncertain. We evaluated the association of ethnicity with cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>) incidence in a large cohort of people with type 2 diabetes living in Scotland.
METHODS:
Data from Scottish Care Information-Diabetes (SCI-Diabetes) were linked to Scottish Morbidity Records (SMR01) and National Records of Scotland data for mortality for dates between 2005 and 2011. Of 156,991 people with type 2 diabetes with coded ethnicity, 121,535 (77.4%) had no <b>CVD</b> at baseline (White: 114,461; Multiple Ethnic: 2,554; Indian: 797; Other Asian: 319; Pakistani: 2,250; Chinese: 387; African-Caribbean: 301 and Other: 466) and were followed up (mean ± SD: 4.8 ± 2.3 years) for the development of fatal and non-fatal <b>CVD</b>.
RESULTS:
During follow-up, 16,265 (13.4%) patients developed <b>CVD</b> (ischaemic heart or cerebrovascular diseases). At baseline, Pakistanis were younger and had developed diabetes earlier, had higher HbA1c and longer duration of diabetes, but had lower BP, BMI, creatinine, proportion of smokers and proportion on antihypertensive therapy than whites. The age and sex adjusted HRs for <b>CVD</b> were HR 1.31 (CI 1.17, 1.47), p  0.001 in Pakistanis and HR 0.66 (CI 0.47, 0.92), p = 0.014 in Chinese compared with whites. Adjusting additionally for an area measure of deprivation, duration of diabetes, conventional <b>CVD</b> and other risk factors, the HR for Pakistanis (HR 1.45 [CI 1.14, 1.85], p = 0.002) was significantly higher, and that for Chinese (HR = 0.58 [CI 0.24, 1.40], p = 0.228) lower, compared with whites.
CONCLUSIONSINTERPRETATION:
Compared with whites with type 2 diabetes, those of Pakistani ethnicity in Scotland were at increased risk of <b>CVD</b>, whereas Chinese were at lower risk, with these differences unexplained by known risk factors.

The aims of the present work were to investigate whether dietary habits are associated with socio-economic status (SES), and if they modify the relationship between SES and <b>CVD</b> risk factors, in a sample of men and women free from known <b>CVD</b>.
METHODS:
This population-based study was carried out in the province of Attica, where Athens is a major metropolis. During 2001-2002, information from 1,528 men (18-87 years old) and 1,514 women (18-89 years old) was collected (75 % participation rate). Among several sociodemographic, clinical and biological factors, adherence to the Mediterranean diet was assessed by a special diet score (Mediterranean Diet Score, MDS) that incorporated the inherent characteristics of this traditional diet. <b>CVD</b> risk factors were examined across the participants' educational level and annual income that defined their SES.
RESULTS:
Low SES groups exhibited higher prevalence of <b>CVD</b> risk factors, such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolaemia (all P  0.001). Low SES groups also showed less adherence to the Mediterranean diet than high SES groups (MDS: 23.6 (sd 8.1) v. 25.6 (sd 5.6), P  0.001). Higher SES index was associated with lower likelihood of having hypercholesterolaemia (OR = 0.91; 95 % CI 0.83, 1.00) and diabetes (OR = 0.83; 95 % CI 0.72, 0.95), after adjusting for various potential confounders. However, the previously mentioned inverse relationship observed between SES and prevalence of <b>CVD</b> risk factors was mainly explained by the dietary habits of the participants.
CONCLUSIONS:
Low SES groups showed less adherence to the Mediterranean diet compared with high SES groups. This finding may, in part, explain the higher <b>CVD</b> risk factors profile observed among low SES participants.
</td></tr><tr><td>47</td><td>25925238</td><td>Prevalence of cardiovascular disease risk factors among a Nigerian adult population: relationship with income level and accessibility to <b>CVD</b> risks screening.</td><td>BACKGROUND:
In Nigeria, reports on the prevalence of modifiable cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>) risk factors are scarce. In addition, socio-economic status (SES), an important component of the socioeconomic gradient in <b>CVD</b> and its risk factors has not been clearly elucidated. This study sought to assess the prevalence of <b>CVD</b> risk factors and how the difference in prevalence and accessibility to <b>CVD</b> risk screening across income levels and educational backgrounds contributes to disease diagnosis in rural and urban Nigerian adults.
METHODS:
A cross sectional study was carried out on a sociocultural ethnic group of persons living in rural and urban settings. All participants were aged ≥ 18 years. The WHO STEPS questionnaire was used to document the demographics, history of previous medical check-up or screening, anthropometric and biochemical measurements of the participants. Average income level and educational status were indicators used to assess the impact of SES. Multivariate analyses were performed to assess any difference between the geographical locations and SES indicators, and prevalence of <b>CVD</b> risk factors and access to <b>CVD</b> risk screening.
RESULTS:
The 422 participants (273 females and 149 males) [corrected] had mean age (± standard deviation) of 38.3 ± 20.5 and 42.9 ± 20.7 years, respectively. Only total cholesterol (p = 0.001), triglyceride (p = 0.005), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) (p  0.0001), body mass index (BMI) (p = 0.03) and average income rate (p = 0.01) showed significant difference between gender groups. Overall prevalence of prediabetes (4.9%), diabetes (5.4%), hypertension (35.7%), low HDL (17.8%), hypertriglyceridemia (23.2%), hypercholesterolemia (38.1%) and central obesity of 52.2% was recorded. Except between total cholesterol (p = 0.042) and HDL (p = 0.017), other <b>CVD</b> risk factors did not show a statistical significance across income levels. Participants with 'university and postgraduate education' had higher access to blood pressure and blood glucose screening compared to other educational groups; and this showed a statistical significance.
CONCLUSION:
This study has shown that a significant number of modifiable <b>CVD</b> risk factors exist in the rural and urban migrants of an adult Nigerian population. While income level did not affect the <b>CVD</b> risk factor prevalence, it did affect accessibility to <b>CVD</b> risk screening. There is a need for access to diagnosis of modifiable risk factors at all levels of society.

Cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>) is on the rise in low- and middle-income countries and is proving difficult to combat due to the emphasis on improving outcomes in maternal and child health and infectious diseases against a backdrop of severe human resource and infrastructure constraints. Effective task-sharing from physicians or nurses to community health workers (CHW) to conduct population-based screening for persons at risk has the potential to mitigate the impact of <b>CVD</b> on vulnerable populations. CHW in Bangladesh, Guatemala, Mexico, and South Africa were trained to conduct noninvasive population-based screening for persons at high risk for <b>CVD</b>.
OBJECTIVES:
This study sought to quantitatively assess the performance of CHW during training and to qualitatively capture their training and fieldwork experiences while conducting noninvasive screening for <b>CVD</b> risk in their communities.
METHODS:
Written tests were used to assess CHW's acquisition of content knowledge during training, and focus group discussions were conducted to capture their training and fieldwork experiences.
RESULTS:
Training was effective at increasing the CHW's content knowledge of <b>CVD</b>, and this knowledge was largely retained up to 6 months after the completion of fieldwork. Common themes that need to be addressed when designing task-sharing with CHW in chronic diseases are identified, including language, respect, and compensation. The importance of having intimate knowledge of the community receiving services from design to implementation is underscored.
CONCLUSIONS:
Effective training for screening for <b>CVD</b> in community settings should have a strong didactic core that is supplemented with culture-specific adaptations in the delivery of instruction. The incorporation of expert and intimate knowledge of the communities themselves is critical, from the design to implementation phases of training. Challenges such as role definition, defining career paths, and providing adequate remuneration must be addressed.

Prospective data on the associations between vitamin D intake and risk of <b>CVD</b> and all-cause mortality are limited and inconclusive. The aim of the present study was to investigate the associations between vitamin D intake and <b>CVD</b> risk and all-cause mortality in the Caerphilly Prospective Cohort Study.
DESIGN:
The associations of vitamin D intake with <b>CVD</b> risk markers were examined cross-sectionally at baseline and longitudinally at 5-year, 10-year and 20-year follow-ups. In addition, the predictive value of vitamin D intake for <b>CVD</b> events and all-cause mortality after 20 years of follow-up was examined. Logistic regression and general linear regression were used for data analysis.
SETTING:
Participants in the UK.
SUBJECTS:
Men (n 452) who were free from <b>CVD</b> and type 2 diabetes at recruitment.
RESULTS:
Higher vitamin D intake was associated with increased HDL cholesterol (P=0·003) and pulse pressure (P=0·04) and decreased total cholesterol:HDL cholesterol (P=0·008) cross-sectionally at baseline, but the associations were lost during follow-up. Furthermore, higher vitamin D intake was associated with decreased concentration of plasma TAG at baseline (P=0·01) and at the 5-year (P=0·01), but not the 10-year examination. After 20 years of follow-up, vitamin D was not associated with stroke (n 72), myocardial infarctions (n 142), heart failure (n 43) or all-cause mortality (n 281), but was positively associated with increased diastolic blood pressure (P=0·03).
CONCLUSIONS:
The study supports associations of higher vitamin D intake with lower fasting plasma TAG and higher diastolic blood pressure.

This study evaluates the effectiveness of three metabolic syndrome (MS) criteria in identifying cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the Chinese population.
METHODS:
3598 subjects were recruited from a cohort study on Prevention of Multiple Metabolic disorders and MS in Jiangsu of China (PMMJS), followed at 6.3 years.

Cox regression model was used to analysis the association between MS and onset of <b>CVD</b> and T2DM. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, sensitivity and specificity were also used to test the ability of three MS criteria to identify <b>CVD</b> or T2DM.
RESULTS:
Among three criteria, CDS has the highest specificity but lowest sensitivity. Using the CDS criterion, over 50 percent of patients would be misdiagnosed. ATPIII criterion has the shortest distance in ROC curve, lowest false positive rate and false negative rate for identifying <b>CVD</b> and T2DM. ATPIII+IDF+ has lower ability to predict <b>CVD</b> than ATPIII+IDF-. ATPIII+IDF+ and ATPIII+IDF- has similar ability to predict T2DM.

Soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) is a highly sensitive marker that reflects increased inflammation and is positively correlated with pro-inflammatory biomarkers. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between suPAR, cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>) risk factors and incidence of <b>CVD</b>.
METHODS:
suPAR was assessed in a random sample of participants (N=569), aged 63-68 years (mean age 65.5), from the Malmö Diet and Cancer Study (MDCS) cardiovascular cohort. Baseline examination was conducted between 1991 and 1994. suPAR in blood was analysed using a commercially available assay (suPARnostic). Cox regression analysis was used to investigate the incidence of <b>CVD</b> (coronary events or ischemic stroke), in relation to sex-specific tertiles of suPAR.
RESULTS:
Significantly higher plasma levels of suPAR was found in women, smokers, diabetics and older subjects. suPAR was significantly positively correlated with markers of systemic inflammation (i.e., high sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and white blood cells (WBC), but not to lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA(2)), a specific vascular inflammatory biomarker.87 subjects had a <b>CVD</b> event during follow-up (mean 14.1 years). In an agesex-adjusted model, the hazard ratio (HR) for incident <b>CVD</b> was 2.53 (95%CI: 1.44-4.46) for the top compared to the bottom tertile of suPAR. This association remained significant after further adjustment for smoking, low density lipoprotein (LDL), systolic blood pressure, use of anti-hypertensive medication, diabetes, hsCRP, WBC and Lp-PLA(2) (HR: 2.25; 1.07-4.72).
CONCLUSION:
Elevated levels of suPAR are, independently of established cardiovascular risk factors, associated with an increased incidence of <b>CVD</b> in elderly subjects.

The relationship between diabetes and increased cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>) risk is well established. Previous data from the Strong Heart Family Study (SHFS) have demonstrated significant heritabilities for <b>CVD</b> risk factors and implicated diabetes as an important predictor of several of the phenotypes in three large groups of American Indians in Arizona (AZ), Oklahoma (OK), and the Dakotas (DK). However, the genetic architecture of this relationship is not well understood. The purpose of the present paper is to determine whether the genetic effects on <b>CVD</b> risk factors in the SHFS are different in diabetic and nondiabetic individuals.
METHODS:
Approximately 950 men and women, 18 years or older, in 32 extended families, were examined between 1997 and 1999. Interaction between genotype and diabetes status was estimated for nine <b>CVD</b> risk factors [body fat mass (FAT), body mass index (BMI), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), log-transformed fibrinogen, log-transformed triglycerides, log-transformed urinary albumin : creatinine ratio (LACR), plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR)], using a maximum likelihood variance decomposition technique.
RESULTS:
We found evidence that genetic factors influencing BMI, FAT, log-transformed triglycerides, HDL-C, and WHR are differentially expressed in individuals with diabetes compared to those without diabetes.
CONCLUSION:
Thus, in the environmental and genetic milieu of diabetes, there may be distinct genetic determinants of various <b>CVD</b> risk factors.

To investigate the burden of modifiable cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>) risk factors in patients admitted to coronary care by age, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status.
DESIGN AND SETTING:
Cross-sectional study of patients presenting to the Middlemore Hospital Coronary Care Unit with an acute <b>CVD</b> event from July 2004 to June 2006.
METHODS:
<b>CVD</b> risk factor data was electronically collected using Acute PREDICT. Socioeconomic status was estimated using the NZ Deprivation 2001 index (NZDep01).
RESULTS:
Of 973 patients 34% were 55 years and 10% were 45 years, 24.8% were women, and 44.6% lived in areas classified as most deprived. 61.5% were Europeanother, 13.0% NZ Maori, 15.2% Pacific, and 10.3% South Asian. Younger patients, regardless of ethnicity, were much more likely to be smokers, be obese, have elevated LDL and trigyceride, and low HDL levels. Maori and Pacific patients were more likely than Europeanother patients to smoke, have diabetes, obesity, elevated triglycerides, and low HDL. These ethnic differences persisted across the age range. Increasing deprivation was associated with more smoking, obesity, hypertriglyceridaemia and diabetes, with the excess of smoking and obesity being most pronounced in younger patients.
CONCLUSIONS:
In patients presenting to coronary care, there is a high burden of adverse modifiable <b>CVD</b> risk factors, particularly in younger patients and among Maori and Pacific people from areas of high deprivation. These risk factors are a major and reversible contributor to future <b>CVD</b> risk in these groups, and an important target for secondary prevention programs.

Decreasing salt consumption can prevent cardiovascular diseases (<b>CVD</b>). Practically, it is difficult to promote people's awareness of daily salt intake and to change their eating habits in terms of reducing salt intake for better cardiovascular health. Health education programs visualizing daily dietary salt content and intake may promote lifestyle changes in patients at high risk of cardiovascular diseases.
METHODSDESIGN:
This is a cluster randomized trial. A total of 800 high-<b>CVD</b>-risk patients attending diabetes and hypertension clinics at health centers in Muang District, Chiang Rai province, Thailand, will be studied with informed consent. A health center recruiting 100 participants is a cluster, the unit of randomization. Eight clusters will be randomized into intervention and control arms and followed up for 1 year. Within the intervention clusters the following will be undertaken: (1) salt content in the daily diet will be measured and shown to study participants; (2) 24-hour salt intake will be estimated in overnight-collected urine and the results shown to the participants; (3) a dietician will assist small group health education classes in cooking meals with less salt. The primary outcome is blood pressure change at the 1-year follow-up. Secondary outcomes at the 1-year follow-up are estimated 24-hoursalt intake, incidence of <b>CVD</b> events and <b>CVD</b> death. The intention-to-treat analysis will be followed.Blood pressure and estimated 24-hour salt intake will be compared between intervention and control groups at the cluster and individual level at the 1-year follow-up. Clinical <b>CVD</b> events and deaths will be analyzed by time-event analysis. Retinal blood vessel calibers of <b>CVD</b>-risk patients will be assessed cross-sectionally. Behavioral change to reduce salt intake and the influencing factors will be determined by structured equation model (SEM). Multilevel regression analyses will be applied. Finally, the cost effectiveness of the intervention will be analyzed.
DISCUSSION:
This study is unique as it will recruit the individuals most vulnerable to <b>CVD</b> morbidity and mortality by applying the general Framingham <b>CVD</b> risk scoring system. Dietary salt reduction will be applied as a prioritized, community level intervention for the prevention of <b>CVD</b> in a developing country.

By a population based cross-sectional case-control design, we genotyped 18 SNPs upstream of CDKN2B tagging 138 kb in and around two LD-blocks associated with <b>CVD</b> and T2D and investigated associations with T2D, angina pectoris (AP), myocardial infarction (MI), coronary heart disease (CHD; AP or AMI), and stroke using 5,564 subjects from HUNT2. Results. Single point and haplotype analysis showed evidence for only one common T2D risk haplotype (rs10757282∣rs10811661: OR = 1.19, P = 2.0 × 10(-3)) in the region. We confirmed the strong association between SNPs in the 60 kb <b>CVD</b> region with AP, MI, and CHD (P  0.01). Conditioning on the lead SNPs in the region, we observed two suggestive independent single SNP association signals for MI, rs2065501  (P = 0.03) and rs3217986  (P = 0.04). Conclusions. We confirmed the association of known variants within the 9p21 interval with T2D and CHD. Our results further suggest that additional CHD susceptibility variants exist in this region.</td></tr><tr><td>57</td><td>27214974</td><td>Underestimating risk in women delays diagnosis of <b>CVD</b>.</td><td><b>CVD</b> remains the most common cause of mortality in women. In 2007, the annual mortality in women secondary to CAD was 4.7 times that of breast cancer. Around 2.8 million women are living with <b>CVD</b> in the UK. There has been an increase in the prevalence of MI in women aged 35 to 54, while a decline in prevalence was observed in age-matched men. Difficulty in evaluating symptoms of ischaemic heart disease in women is well documented and remains challenging because of their atypical nature. The main gender difference is that women tend to present less frequently with exertional symptoms of chest pain before an AMI. Although men and women share classic cardiovascular risk factors the relative importance of each risk factor may be gender specific. The impact of smoking is greater in women than men, especially in those under 50. Diabetes is a more potent risk factor for fatal CHD in women than men. Risk factors specific to women include postmenopausal status, hysterectomy and complications during pregnancy. Women who develop gestational diabetes mellitus or pre-eclampsia more than double their risk of <b>CVD</b> later in life. Transition to the menopause is associated with a worsening CHD risk profile. After the menopause women may experience an increase in weight, alteration in fat distribution and an increase in other <b>CVD</b> risk factors such as diabetes and a more adverse lipid profile. Pharmacological stress testing is preferred for diagnosing CAD in females with lower exercise capacity. Stress cardiomyopathy is triggered by intense, unexpected emotional or physical stress and is characterised by transient apical systolic dysfunction or ballooning of the left ventricle. The syndrome predominantly affects postmenopausal women. Women presenting with STEMI have worse outcomes compared with men. However, in those presenting with NSTEMI there were no differences in outcomes.</td></tr><tr><td>58</td><td>27264785</td><td>Association between dietary fibre intake and fruit, vegetable or whole-grain consumption and the risk of <b>CVD</b>: results from the PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) trial.</td><td>Prospective studies assessing the association between fibre intake or fibre-rich food consumption and the risk of <b>CVD</b> have often been limited by baseline assessment of diet. Thus far, no study has used yearly repeated measurements of dietary changes during follow-up. Moreover, previous studies included healthy and selected participants who did not represent subjects at high cardiovascular risk. We used yearly repeated measurements of diet to investigate the association between fibre intake and <b>CVD</b> in a Mediterranean cohort of elderly adults at high cardiovascular risk. We followed-up 7216 men (55-80 years) and women (60-80 years) initially free of <b>CVD</b> for up to 7 years in the PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea study (registered as ISRCTN35739639). A 137-item validated FFQ was repeated yearly to assess diet. The primary end point, confirmed by a blinded ad hoc Event Adjudication Committee, was a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction and stroke. Time-dependent Cox's regression models were used to estimate the risk of <b>CVD</b> according to baseline dietary exposures and to their yearly updated changes. We found a significant inverse association for fibre (P for trend=0·020) and fruits (P for trend=0·024) in age-sex adjusted models, but the statistical significance was lost in fully adjusted models. However, we found a significant inverse association with <b>CVD</b> incidence for the sum of fruit and vegetable consumption. Participants who consumed in total nine or more servingsd of fruits plus vegetables had a hazard ratio 0·60 (95 % CI 0·40, 0·96) of <b>CVD</b> in comparison with those consuming 5 servingsd.</td></tr><tr><td>59</td><td>26189083</td><td>Clinical significance of urinary liver-type fatty acid-binding protein as a predictor of ESRD and <b>CVD</b> in patients with CKD.</td><td>BACKGROUND:
To improve outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), it is important to identify prognostic factors for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) as well as cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>). This study assessed urinary concentrations of albumin, N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), and liver-type fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP), as predictors of ESRD and <b>CVD</b>.
METHODS:
A prospective, observational, multicenter study, comprising 244 Japanese outpatients with CKD who had a follow-up period of at least 3 months. The primary endpoint was the first onset of a nonfatal or fatal <b>CVD</b> event and progression to ESRD, defined as myocardial infarction, stroke, or artery revascularization (coronary, carotid or peripheral), and initiation of dialysis.
RESULTS:
During a median follow-up of 3.8 years, the primary endpoint occurred in 39 (15.8 %) patients. Irrespective of diabetes, high urinary L-FABP correlated with the development of ESRD and <b>CVD</b>. The areas under the receiver-operator characteristic curves (AUCs) for predicting the primary endpoint for urinary concentrations of L-FABP, albumin, and NAG were 0.825, 0.797, and 0.722, respectively. Cox regression analyses, which were adjusted for factors known to influence the primary endpoint, including patient characteristics, and serum and urinary parameters, demonstrated that the primary outcome was associated with high urinary L-FABP and low eGFR [p = 0.049, hazard ratio = 1.341 (95 % CI 1.005-1.790); and p  0.000, hazard ratio = 0.953 (95 % CI 0.930-0.976), respectively].
CONCLUSIONS:
Urinary L-FABP may be a useful prognostic marker of progression to ESRD and the onset of <b>CVD</b> in patients with CKD.

Abnormal daily sleep duration and quality have been linked to hypertension, diabetes, stroke, and overall cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>) morbidity& mortality. However, the relationship between daily sleep duration and quality with subclinical measures of <b>CVD</b> remains less well studied. This systematic review evaluated how daily sleep duration and quality affect burden of subclinical <b>CVD</b> in subjects free of symptomatic <b>CVD</b>.
METHODS:
Literature search was done via MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science until June 2016 and 32 studies met the inclusion criteria. Sleep duration and quality were measured either via subjective methods, as self-reported questionnaires or Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) or via objective methods, as actigraphy or polysomnography or by both. Among subclinical <b>CVD</b> measures, coronary artery calcium (CAC) was measured by electron beam computed tomography, Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) measured by high-resolution B-mode ultrasound on carotid arteries, endothelialmicrovascular function measured by flow mediated dilation (FMD) or peripheral arterial tone (PAT) or iontophoresis or nailfold capillaroscopy, and arterial stiffness measured by pulse wave velocity (PWV) or ankle brachial index (ABI).
RESULTS:
Subjective short sleep duration was associated with CAC and CIMT, but variably associated with endothelial dysfunction (ED) and arterial stiffness; however, subjective long sleep duration was associated with CAC, CIMT and arterial stiffness, but variably associated with ED. Objective short sleep duration was positively associated with CIMT and variably with CAC but not associated with ED. Objective long sleep duration was variably associated with CAC and CIMT but not associated with ED. Poor subjective sleep quality was significantly associated with ED and arterial stiffness but variably associated with CAC and CIMT. Poor objective sleep quality was significantly associated with CIMT, and ED but variably associated with CAC.
CONCLUSIONS:
Overall, our review provided mixed results, which is generally in line with published literature, with most of the studies showing a significant relationship with subclinical <b>CVD</b>, but only some studies failed to demonstrate such an association. Although such mechanistic relationship needs further evaluation in order to determine appropriate screening strategies in vulnerable populations, this review strongly suggested the existence of a relationship between abnormal sleep duration and quality with increased subclinical <b>CVD</b> burden.

Although strong associations have been found between renal disease and the risk of cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>) the interaction between these two factors is not well understood. This study, which addresses risk factors for mortality in IDDM with a particular focus on the renal-<b>CVD</b> link, is based on the prospective Epidemiology of Diabetes Complications study. Thirty-seven (mean age 36 years, mean duration of IDDM 28 years at baseline) of the 658 IDDM individuals (mean age 28 years, mean duration of IDDM 20 years at baseline) have died in the first 4 years of follow up. A nested case-control study was performed, matching on sex and duration of diabetes. Twenty-two (59%) of the deaths were attributed to coronary heart disease, with an additional 16% attributed to diabetic coma. Only nine (41%) of the 22 individuals who died from cardiovascular disease had clinical evidence of coronary heart disease when seen for their last biennial exam. However, 54% of those who died of <b>CVD</b> without prior evidence did have evidence of lower extremity arterial disease. A strong link with renal disease was confirmed, with 81% of those with a coronary artery disease death having renal disease. Multivariate analyses suggest that smoking history, triglycerides and total platelet count are independent predictors of mortality, while LDL cholesterol best predicted <b>CVD</b> mortality. These results suggest a need for more intensive screening for cardiovascular disease, and correction of cardiovascular risk factors, in order to reduce the increased rate of mortality in this population. Efforts to prevent or delay the onset of renal disease may also be of benefit.</td></tr><tr><td>62</td><td>20186243</td><td>A comparative analysis of the cardiovascular disease risk factor profiles of Pacific peoples and Europeans living in New Zealand assessed in routine primary care: PREDICT <b>CVD</b>-11.</td><td>AIM:
To investigate the differences in the baseline cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>) risk profiles of Pacific peoples and Europeans assessed in routine primary care practice by PREDICT, a web-based clinical decision support programme for assessing and managing <b>CVD</b> risk.
METHODS:
PREDICT has been implemented in primary care practices from nine consenting PHOs in Auckland and Northland. Between 2002 and January 2009, over 70,000 <b>CVD</b> risk assessments were conducted. These analyses compare <b>CVD</b> risk factors for Pacific and European patients.
RESULTS:
Baseline risk assessments were completed for 39,835 Europeans and 10,301 Pacific peoples aged 35-74 years. Over 85% of the Pacific cohort was comprised of the four main Pacific ethnic groups in New Zealand (Samoan, Tongan, Cook Island Maori and Niuean). Fijians (n=1341) were excluded from the analyses because of a likely misclassification error with Indian Fijians. On average, Pacific peoples in the PREDICT cohort were 4 years younger at the time of risk assessment than Europeans, and were overrepresented in areas of high socioeconomic deprivation. At risk assessment, Pacific men were 1.5 times as likely to be current smokers as European men, whereas similar or lower proportions of Pacific women smoked compared with European women. Pacific peoples were approximately three times more likely to have diabetes as Europeans. Pacific peoples had higher diastolic blood pressures and Pacific women had higher total cholesterolHDL ratios. Both Pacific men and women had a significantly higher predicted risk of <b>CVD</b> in the next 5 years than Europeans, based on the Framingham risk score.
CONCLUSIONS:
The PREDICT programme has already generated the largest cohort of Pacific peoples ever to be studied in New Zealand. This comparative analysis of patients who have been screened highlights significant disparities in <b>CVD</b> risk factors for Pacific peoples particularly for diabetes in both sexes and for smoking in men. Targeting these modifiable risk factors will be important in addressing the widening inequalities in <b>CVD</b> outcomes between Pacific peoples and Europeans.

There is also accumulating evidence indicating that chronic sub-clinical inflammation as measured by such inflammatory markers as C-reactive protein (CRP) is associated with insulin resistance and other features of the insulin resistance syndrome, increased risk of development of type 2 diabetes and increased cardiovascular event risk. Insulin-sensitizing agents may have greater effects in reducing cardiovascular risk than secretagogues in the pre-diabetic state, and glitazones have been found to decrease CRP levels in patients with diabetes. Statins also reduce CRP levels. Efforts to reduce <b>CVD</b> should include increased emphasis on improving glycaemic control, preventing development of diabetes and addressing cardiovascular risk factors in the pre-diabetic state.</td></tr><tr><td>64</td><td>25697289</td><td>Vitamin D and risk of <b>CVD</b>: a review of the evidence.</td><td>This review summarises evidence for an association between vitamin D status and <b>CVD</b> and the mechanisms involved. Vitamin D3 is predominantly provided by the action of UVB from sunlight on skin. Average UK diets supply 2-3 μgd vitamin D but diets containing at least one portion of oily fish per week supply about 7 μgd. Pharmacological doses of vitamin D2 (bolus injection of 7500 μg or intakes 50 μgd) result in a smaller increase in plasma 25(OH)D than those of D3 but physiological doses 5-25 μgd seem equivalent. Plasma 25(OH)D concentrations are also influenced by clothing, obesity and skin pigmentation. Up to 40 % of the population have plasma 25(OH)D concentrations 25 nmoll in the winter compared with 10 % in the summer. The relative risk of <b>CVD</b> death is 1·41 (95 % CI 1·18, 1·68) greater in the lowest quintile of plasma 25(OH)D according to meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies. Acute deficiency may inhibit insulin secretion and promote inflammation thus increasing the risk of plaque rupture and arterial thrombosis. Chronic insufficiency may increase arterial stiffness. There is no evidence to support claims of reduced <b>CVD</b> from existing trials with bone-related health outcomes where vitamin D was usually co-administered with calcium. Although several trials with cardiovascular endpoints are in progress, these are using pharmacological doses. In view of the potential toxicity of pharmacological doses, there remains a need for long-term trials of physiological doses of D2 and D3 with <b>CVD</b> incidence as the primary outcome.</td></tr><tr><td>65</td><td>27329952</td><td>Pharmacological Targeting of the Atherogenic Dyslipidemia Complex: The Next Frontier in <b>CVD</b> Prevention Beyond Lowering LDL Cholesterol.</td><td>Notwithstanding the effectiveness of lowering LDL cholesterol, residual <b>CVD</b> risk remains in high-risk populations, including patients with diabetes, likely contributed to by non-LDL lipid abnormalities. In this Perspectives in Diabetes article, we emphasize that changing demographics and lifestyles over the past few decades have resulted in an epidemic of the "atherogenic dyslipidemia complex," the main features of which include hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL cholesterol levels, qualitative changes in LDL particles, accumulation of remnant lipoproteins, and postprandial hyperlipidemia. We briefly review the underlying pathophysiology of this form of dyslipidemia, in particular its association with insulin resistance, obesity, and type 2 diabetes, and the marked atherogenicity of this condition. We explain the failure of existing classes of therapeutic agents such as fibrates, niacin, and cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors that are known to modify components of the atherogenic dyslipidemia complex. Finally, we discuss targeted repurposing of existing therapies and review promising new therapeutic strategies to modify the atherogenic dyslipidemia complex. We postulate that targeting the central abnormality of the atherogenic dyslipidemia complex, the elevation of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particles, represents a new frontier in <b>CVD</b> prevention and is likely to prove the most effective strategy in correcting most aspects of the atherogenic dyslipidemia complex, thereby preventing <b>CVD</b> events.</td></tr><tr><td>66</td><td>27215285</td><td>Whole-grain consumption and the risk of all-cause, <b>CVD</b> and cancer mortality: a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies.</td><td>Results of the relationships between dietary whole-grain consumption and the risk of all-cause, <b>CVD</b> and cancer-specific mortality are mixed.

Pertinent studies were identified by searching articles in the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases up to 20 January 2016 and by reviewing the reference lists of the retrieved articles. Random-effects models were used to calculate summary relative risks (SRR) and 95 % CI. In all, eleven prospective studies (ten publications) were included in the meta-analysis. There were a total of 816 599 subjects and 89 251 cases of all-cause mortality. On the basis of the highest v. the lowest categories of intake, whole grains may be associated with a lower risk of mortality from all causes (SRR 0·87; 95 % CI 0·84, 0·90), <b>CVD</b> (SRR 0·81; 95 % CI 0·75, 0·89) and all cancers (SRR 0·89; 95 % CI 0·82, 0·96). For each 3 servingsd increase in whole-grain intake, there was a 19 % reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality (SRR 0·81; 95 % CI 0·76, 0·85), a 26 % reduction in <b>CVD</b> mortality (SRR 0·74; 95 % CI 0·66, 0·83) and a 9 % reduction in cancer mortality (SRR 0·91; 95 % CI 0·84, 0·98).

The literature search was conducted using Embase, Medline and the Cochrane library, which identified 654 potential articles. Seventy-six articles describing sixty-nine studies met the inclusion criteria. Most studies lacked statistical power to detect a significant effect of oats on any of the risk factors considered: 59 % of studies had less than thirty subjects in the oat intervention group. Out of sixty-four studies that assessed systemic lipid markers, thirty-seven (58 %) and thirty-four (49 %) showed a significant reduction in total cholesterol (2-19 % reduction) and LDL-cholesterol (4-23 % reduction) respectively, mostly in hypercholesterolaemic subjects. Few studies (three and five, respectively) described significant effects on HDL-cholesterol and TAG concentrations. Only three out of twenty-five studies found a reduction in blood pressure after oat consumption. None of the few studies that measured markers of insulin sensitivity and inflammation found any effect after long-term oat consumption. Long-term dietary intake of oats or oat bran has a beneficial effect on blood cholesterol. However, there is no evidence that it favourably modulates insulin sensitivity. It is still unclear whether increased oat consumption significantly affects other risk markers for <b>CVD</b> risk, and comprehensive, adequately powered and controlled intervention trials are required to address this question.</td></tr><tr><td>68</td><td>18653028</td><td>Prevalence of risk factors in acute ischemic cerebrovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>) in elderly patients from eastern Sicily.</td><td>Hundred and forty elderly patients (76 males and 64 females, over 65 years of age) were consecutively admitted to the Institute between November 1989 and April 1993, in order to (i) verify if the risk factors, reported in other Italian areas and regions of the world, are prevalent also in our region, and (ii) outline a secondary prevention strategy against the statistically most important risk factors. There were 111 cases of ischemic stroke (58 males and 53 females) and 29 cases of reversible ischemic attack (RIA) (18 males and 11 females). The percental occurrence of the following risk factors were determined: total cholesterol  240 mgdl, HDL cholesterol  35 mgdl, triglycerides  180 mgdl, fibrinogen  450 mgdl, hematocrit  45%, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, familial ischemic events, previous ischemic <b>CVD</b>, ischemic cardiac disease, embolic cardiopathy. In males with ischemic stroke the most frequent risk factors were: hypertension (43%), fibrinogen  450 mgdl (37.9%), diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking and previous ischemic <b>CVD</b> (25.8%). In females with ischemic stroke a clear prevalence of hypertension (69.8%), ischemic cardiopathy and previous ischemic <b>CVD</b> (47%) and diabetes mellitus (41.5%) were observed. In males with RIA hypertension (50%) and cigarette smoking (38%). Females with RIA presented a high prevalence of reduced HDL cholesterol, lower than 35 mgdl (77.7%), hypertension (63.6%) and ischemic cardiopathy (54.5%). The results indicate that there are no highly significant differences between the data reported by other authors on the most important acute ischemic <b>CVD</b> risk factors in Italy and elsewhere. Arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus are the most important risk factors of cerebral ischemic events in both sexes. The diffusion of cigarette smoking among women in the last thirty years must be taken into consideration.

To assess the effect of dietary flavonoids on cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>) risk in postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes on established statin and hypoglycemic therapy.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS:
Despite being medicated, patients with type 2 diabetes have elevated <b>CVD</b> risk, particularly postmenopausal women. Although dietary flavonoids have been shown to reduce <b>CVD</b> risk factors in healthy participants, no long-term trials have examined the additional benefits of flavonoids to <b>CVD</b> risk in medicated postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes. We conducted a parallel-design, placebo-controlled trial with type 2 diabetic patients randomized to consume 27 gday (split dose) flavonoid-enriched chocolate (containing 850 mg flavan-3-ols [90 mg epicatechin] and 100 mg isoflavones [aglycone equivalents)]day) or matched placebo for 1 year.
RESULTS:
Ninety-three patients completed the trial, and adherence was high (flavonoid 91.3%; placebo 91.6%). Compared with the placebo group, the combined flavonoid intervention resulted in a significant reduction in estimated peripheral insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance [HOMA-IR] -0.3 ± 0.2; P = 0.004) and improvement in insulin sensitivity (quantitative insulin sensitivity index [QUICKI] 0.003 ± 0.00; P = 0.04) as a result of a significant decrease in insulin levels (-0.8 ± 0.5 mUL; P = 0.02). Significant reductions in total cholesterol:HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio (-0.2 ± 0.1; P = 0.01) and LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) (-0.1 ± 0.1 mmolL; P = 0.04) were also observed. Estimated 10-year total coronary heart disease risk (derived from UK Prospective Diabetes Study algorithm) was attenuated after flavonoid intervention (flavonoid +0.1 ± 0.3 vs. placebo 1.1 ± 0.3; P = 0.02). No effect on blood pressure, HbA(1c), or glucose was observed.
CONCLUSIONS:
One-year intervention with flavan-3-ols and isoflavones improved biomarkers of <b>CVD</b> risk, highlighting the additional benefit of flavonoids to standard drug therapy in managing <b>CVD</b> risk in postmenopausal type 2 diabetic patients.

Data on the cardiovascular disease risk profiles of Pacific peoples in New Zealand is usually aggregated and treated as a single entity. Little is known about the comparability or otherwise of cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>) risk between different Pacific groups.
AIM:
To compare <b>CVD</b> risk profiles for the main Pacific ethnic groups assessed in New Zealand primary care practice to determine if it is reasonable to aggregate these data, or if significant differences exist.
METHODS:
A web-based clinical decision support system for <b>CVD</b> risk assessment and management (PREDICT) has been implemented in primary care practices in nine PHOs throughout Auckland and Northland since 2002, covering approximately 65% of the population of these regions. Between 2002 and January 2009, baseline <b>CVD</b> risk assessments were carried out on 11,642 patients aged 35-74 years identifying with one or more Pacific ethnic groups (4933 Samoans, 1724 Tongans, 1366 Cook Island Maori, 880 Niueans, 1341 Fijians and 1398 people identified as Other Pacific or Pacific Not Further Defined). Fijians were subsequently excluded from the analyses because of a probable misclassification error that appears to combine Fijian Indians with ethnic Fijians. Prevalences of smoking, diabetes and prior history of <b>CVD</b>, as well as mean total cholesterolHDL ratio, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and Framingham 5-year <b>CVD</b> risk were calculated for each Pacific group. Age-adjusted risk ratios and mean differences stratified by gender were calculated using Samoans as the reference group.
RESULTS:
Cook Island women were almost 60% more likely to smoke than Samoan women. While Tongan men had the highest proportion of smoking (29%) among Pacific men, Tongan women had the lowest smoking proportion (10%) among Pacific women. Tongan women and Niuean men and women had a higher burden of diabetes than other Pacific ethnic groups, which were 20-30% higher than their Samoan counterparts. Niuean men and women had lower blood pressure levels than all other Pacific groups while Tongan men and women had the highest total cholesterol to HDL ratios. Tongan men and women had higher absolute 5-year <b>CVD</b> risk scores, as estimated by the Framingham equation, than their Samoan counterparts (Age-adjusted mean differences 0.71% [95% CI 0.36% to 1.06%] for Tongan men and 0.52% [95% CI 0.17% to 0.86%] for Tongan women) although these risk differences were only about 10% higher in relative terms.
CONCLUSION:
The validity of the analyses depend on the assumption that the selection of participants for <b>CVD</b> risk assessment in primary care is similar between Pacific groups. The ethnic-specific <b>CVD</b> risk profiles presented do not represent estimates of population prevalence. Almost all previous Pacific data has been aggregated with Pacific peoples treated as a single entity because of small sample sizes. We have analysed data from the largest study to date measuring <b>CVD</b> risk factors in Pacific peoples living in New Zealand. Our findings suggest that aggregating Pacific population data appears to be reasonable in terms of assessing absolute <b>CVD</b> risk, however there are differences for specific <b>CVD</b> risk factors between Pacific ethnic groups that may be important for targeting community level interventions.
</td></tr><tr><td>72</td><td>16459222</td><td>Effect of a low glycemic index diet with soy protein and phytosterols on <b>CVD</b> risk factors in postmenopausal women.</td><td>OBJECTIVES:
Cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>) is the leading cause of death in women. Hyperlipidemia is a major risk factor for <b>CVD</b>, but research suggests that metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes are also key factors in <b>CVD</b> in postmenopausal women. Most dietary programs, however, focus only on hyperlipidemia and not on insulin resistance associated with diabetes and metabolic syndrome. This 12-wk trial compared the effects of a dietary program combining a low glycemic index diet with a functional food delivering 30 g of soy protein and 4 g of phytosterols per day (LGID) with a standard dietary program (American Heart Association Step 1 diet; AHAD) in postmenopausal women.
METHODS:
Fifty-nine postmenopausal women (average age 54.6 y, range 44-65 y) with a body mass index of 27 to 39 kgm2 were randomly assigned to the LGID or the AHAD program for 12 wk. Total caloric intake and exercise were matched in each arm.
RESULTS:
Twenty-seven women completed the LGID program, and 26 completed the AHAD program. The participants on the LGID program showed statistically significant decreases in total cholesterol (15.8%, P = 0.0036 between-group comparison), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (14.8%, P = 0.004 between-group comparison), and triacylglycerol (44.8%, P = 0.006 between-group comparison). In addition, significant improvements were observed in ratios of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and of triacylglycerol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, blood pressure, and Framingham risk assessment for coronary heart disease compared with the AHAD program.
CONCLUSIONS:
A significantly greater improvement was observed in <b>CVD</b> risk factors in postmenopausal women on the LGID program (incorporating 30 g of soy protein and 4 g of phytosterols per day) than with a standard therapy.

The pilot study of this program was done in Oskoo in 2007-2009. In this study, demographic data and <b>CVD</b> risk factors of 37,329 adults aged ≥30 years old living in Oskoo were collected. In addition, blood samples of 17,388 adults ≥40 years old were taken (free of charge) for assessment of serum glucose and lipid profile.
RESULTS:
The study covered 93.52% of Oskoo town population aged≥30 years old. We studied 18637 male (91.50% coverage) and 18692 female (95.52% coverage) participants. The incidence of HTN [SBP≥140 & DBP≥90 mmHg] was 16.25% (M:15.08%, F:17.29%), pre-hypertension [SBP=120-139 & DBP=80-89 mmHg] =37.78% (M:41.38%, F:34.18%), DM [fast blood glucose (FBS)≥126mgdl] was 7.45% (M:6.35%, F:8.54%), smoking was 9.40% (M:17.00%, F:1.57%), hypercholesterolemia (200mgdl) was 47.64% (M:42.46%, F:52.81%) and obesity [body mass index (BMI) ≥27] was 50.47% (M:38.79%, F:62.09%).
CONCLUSION:
Considering high incidence of <b>CVD</b> risk factors (except smoking) in Oskoo adults ≥30 years, it is recommended that this pilot study expanded to all of East Azerbaijan. Free of charge taking blood samples from people ≥ 40 years to evaluate lipid profile and glucose levels is worthy to early detecting the prevalent DM or DLP in this target population.

Reduced heart rate variability (HRV) and increased arterial stiffness (AS) are both present in youth with type 1 diabetes. However, it is unclear whether they are associated and whether their association is independent of cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>) risk factors.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS:
The SEARCH Cardiovascular Disease (SEARCH <b>CVD</b>) study explored the cross-sectional relationships between HRV and several measures of AS in youth with (n = 344) and without (n = 171) type 1 diabetes. The SphygmoCor device (AtCor Medical, Sydney, Australia) was used to measure HRV using SD of normal R-R interval (SDNN), as well as AS, using pulse wave velocity in the carotid to femoral segment (PWV-trunk) and augmentation index adjusted to a heart rate of 75 bpm (AIx75). Brachial distensibility (BrachD), another index of AS, was measured with a DynaPulse instrument (Pulse Metric, San Diego, CA). Multiple linear regression analyses explored the associations between HRV and each of the three AS measures, after adjusting for demographic characteristics and traditional <b>CVD</b> risk factors (blood pressure, lipids, obesity, microalbuminuria, and smoking) separately, for youth with and without type 1 diabetes.
RESULTS:
Among youth with type 1 diabetes, lower SDNN was associated with peripheral AS (lower BrachD, P = 0.01; r(2) = 0.30) and central AS (higher PVW-trunk, P  0.0001; r(2) = 0.37; and higher AIx75, P = 0.007; r(2) = 0.08). These associations were attenuated with adjustment for <b>CVD</b> risk factors, but remained statistically significant for BrachD and PWV-trunk. While a similar association between HRV and BrachD was present in control youth, lower HRV was not associated with increased central AS or with AIx75.
CONCLUSIONS:
Longitudinal studies are needed to understand the pathways responsible for these associations.

While identification of this increased risk is crucial to allow for effective treatment, there is controversy over the applicability of diagnostic criteria, and particularly measures of adiposity in ethnic minorities. Diagnostic cut-offs for BMI and waist circumference have been largely derived from predominantly white Caucasian populations and, therefore, have been inappropriate and not transferable to Asian groups. Many Asian populations, particularly South Asians, have a higher total and central adiposity for a similar body weight compared with matched Caucasians and greater <b>CVD</b> risk associated with a lower BMI. Although the causes of <b>CVD</b> and T2D are multi-factorial, diet is thought to make a substantial contribution to the development of these diseases. Low dietary intakes and tissue levels of long-chain (LC) n-3 PUFA in South Asian populations have been linked to high-risk abnormalities in the MetS. Conversely, increasing the dietary intake of LC n-3 PUFA in South Asians has proved an effective strategy for correcting such abnormalities as dyslipidaemia in the MetS. Appropriate diagnostic criteria that include a modified definition of adiposity must be in place to facilitate the early detection and thus targeted treatment of increased risk in ethnic minorities.</td></tr><tr><td>76</td><td>24532105</td><td>Evaluation of Factor V G1691A, prothrombin G20210A, Factor XIII V34L, MTHFR A1298C, MTHFR C677T and PAI-1 4G5G genotype frequencies of patients subjected to cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>) panel in south-east region of Turkey.</td><td>Cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>) risk factors, such as arterial hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia or diabetes mellitus, as well as CVDs, including myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease or stroke, are the most prevalent diseases and account for the major causes of death worldwide.

Definitions of the syndrome vary but in general agree closely in identifying subjects. The relationships between the metabolic syndrome and atherosclerotic <b>CVD</b> and diabetes also vary, with relative risks of approximately 1.5-3.0 and approximately 3.0-5.0 respectively. Insulin resistance appears to explain much of the pathophysiology of the syndrome. Both increased fatty acid flux and an excess of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines are likely mediators. With increased waist circumference, increases in fatty acid delivery to the liver result in higher rates of hepatic glucose production and increases in the secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins. Concomitant changes in HDL ensue, including a replacement of the cholesterol content with TAG, an accelerated clearance from the plasma and thus a reduced number of HDL particles. Typically also present are increases in small dense LDL. Hypertension in part relates to the insulin resistance, but may involve other mechanisms. Impaired fasting glucose often relates to defects in insulin secretion in addition to insulin resistance, and probably more than any other component of the syndrome predicts the increased incidence of type 2 diabetes. Although not included in the diagnostic criteria, increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines and pro-thrombotic factors, in addition to decreases in plasma adiponectin, may also contribute to the increased incidence of atherosclerotic <b>CVD</b> and diabetes. In general, the greater the number of metabolic syndrome components, the greater the risk for these outcomes.

Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality have been associated with different variables of anthropometric measurements.
AIM:
To find out the association of anthropometric measurements in the development of Cardiovascular Disease (<b>CVD</b>) and stroke among Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM).
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
Three hundred subjects were included in the study out of which 100 subjects were known type 2 diabetics with <b>CVD</b> or Stroke (Group 1), 100 subjects were type 2 diabetic patients (Group 2) and 100 subjects were normal and healthy (Group 3). Blood Pressure (BP), Body Mass Index (BMI) Neck Circumference (NC), Waist Circumference (WC), Hip Circumference (HC), Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), high sensitive- C-Reactive Protein (hsCRP), Malondialdehyde (MDA), Homocysteine (Hcy), microalbuminuria and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were compared between all three groups by using one-way ANOVA test, comparison between males and females by t-test and association was done by using Chi-square test.
RESULTS:
There were a significant difference in the means of anthropometric and biochemical parameters of the three groups (p0.05). Diastolic BP, NC, WC, HC and homocysteine, are higher in T2DM obese patients than T2DM over weight and normal weight patients are statistically significant (p0.05). The mean of levels systolic BP, Diastolic BP, hsCRP are higher in T2DM over weight patients than T2DM obese and normal weight patients are statistically significant (p0.05). Association of physical activity, snoring and interrupted sleep with BMI was statistical significant (p0.05).
CONCLUSION:
Obesity and overweight in T2DM patients play important role in elevation of blood pressure and inflammation markers like hsCRP, homocysteine. Snoring and interrupted sleep also involved development of <b>CVD</b> and Stroke among T2 diabetes.

Anthropometric cut-off values derived for Caucasians may not be applicable to other populations. The main objective of the present study was to derive population-specific anthropometric cut-off values to define high <b>CVD</b> risk for Sri Lankan adults. A nationally representative sample of 4474 non-institutionalised adults aged ≥ 18 years was analysed. Cut-off values to provide optimum sensitivity and specificity were derived using receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis. BMI, waist circumference (WC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), blood pressure and overnight fasting venous blood samples were collected to measure glucose, HDL-cholesterol and TAG. An oral glucose tolerance test was also performed. The results suggested that the age-adjusted BMI, WC and WHR were significantly associated with all cardiovascular risk factors (P  0·001). Cut-off values for BMI, WC and WHR for males were 20·7 kgm2, 76·5 cm and 0·89, respectively. The respective values for females were 22·0 kgm2, 76·3 cm and 0·85. The common cut-off value for BMI for males and females was 21·5 kgm2. Similarly, WC and WHR cut-off values for both males and females were 76·3 cm and 0·87, respectively. The Asian and Caucasian anthropometric cut-off levels showed lower sensitivity and higher false negative percentage compared with newly derived cut-off levels. In conclusion, BMI, WC and WHR were all associated with increased <b>CVD</b> risk. We propose the following anthropometric cut-off points to determine high <b>CVD</b> risk level for Sri Lankan adults: BMI ≥ 21·5 kgm2, WC ≥ 76 cm and WHR ≥ 0·85 (women) and 0·90 (men).</td></tr><tr><td>81</td><td>24010960</td><td>Impact of glycemic control on heart rate variability in youth with type 1 diabetes: the SEARCH <b>CVD</b> study.</td><td>AIM:
This study explored the role of glycemic control on cardiac autonomic function, measured by heart rate variability (HRV), in youth with type 1 diabetes.
PATIENTS AND METHODS:
A retrospective cohort of 345 youth with type 1 diabetes (mean age, 18.5 years; duration, 10 years) participating in the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth study were enrolled in the ancillary SEARCH Cardiovascular Disease (<b>CVD</b>) study. Anthropometric, metabolic, and HRV parameters were collected at the current research visit. Glycemic control over time was assessed by the mean glycated hemoglobin (A1c) levels collected over the past 6 years. Multiple linear regression analysis assessed the association between A1c over time and HRV parameters, independent of demographic and <b>CVD</b> risk factors. Participants were categorized into four glycemic control categories based on their mean A1c over time: Group 1, optimal (mean A1c, ≤7.4%); Group 2 (mean A1c, 7.5-8.4%); Group 3 (mean A1c, 8.5-9.4%), and Group 4, poor (mean A1c, ≥9.5%), and a linear trend was explored across these categories.
RESULTS:
For every 1% increase in the average A1c over 6 years there was a 5% decrease in the SD of the normal RR interval (SDNN) (P=0.02) and 7% decrease in the root mean square successive difference of the RR interval (RMSSD) (P=0.02), independent of demographic and traditional <b>CVD</b> risk factors. A dose-response relationship between worsening glucose control categories and measures of overall reduced HRV was found.
CONCLUSIONS:
Chronic hyperglycemia is the main determinant of early cardiac autonomic dysfunction, manifested as reduced overall HRV and parasympathetic loss, among youth with type 1 diabetes.
</td></tr><tr><td>82</td><td>24636522</td><td>High serum phosphate and triglyceride levels in smoking women and men with <b>CVD</b> risk and type 2 diabetes.</td><td>BACKGROUND:
Both low and high serum phosphate levels may be associated with morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease. As smoking increases risk for type 2 diabetes (as shown by dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia), we wanted to study whether smoking and type 2 diabetes were associated with serum phosphate and triglyceride levels independently from other <b>CVD</b> risk factors.
METHODS:
Upon admittance to the Vindeln Health Education Centre (VHE-centre) for a four-week comprehensive lifestyle intervention, the participants (1408 women and 1096 men) completed a questionnaire that included their smoking habits - current smoker or non-smoker. We used multiple linear regression analyses to investigate the association between smoking and other <b>CVD</b> risk factors with S-P and S-TG levels.
RESULTS:
In the non-type 2 diabetes populations, the smokers, compared to the non-smokers, had higher S-P and higher serum triglycerides (S-TG). In women, serum-TG in smokers with type 2 diabetes was higher than in smokers with non-type 2 diabetes. Non-type 2 diabetes patients exhibited an inverse relation between S-Glucose (S-Glu) and S-P and a positive association with S-TG. For men only, an association was seen between age (-) and S-Crea (-) and S-P. For women only, an association was seen between BMI (-) and S-Cholesterol (+) (S-Chol) and S-P.
CONCLUSIONS:
Compared to non-smokers, smoking women with non-type 2 diabetes and smoking men with type 2 diabetes had a higher level of S-P and S-TG. The association between smoking and S-P and S-TG levels still existed after adjusting for age and <b>CVD</b> risk factors in the multiple linear regression analyses.

To determine if the reduction of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) volume by lifestyle intervention improved risk factors for cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>) independent of weight loss amount.
DESIGN:
Ancillary study of randomized-controlled trial.
SETTING:
Data analysis using multivariable regression models.
PARTICIPANTS:
Participants of the Look AHEAD (Action for HEAlth in Diabetes) Fatty Liver Ancillary Study.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
Correlations between changes in VAT and in <b>CVD</b> risk factors, while adjusting for weight loss and treatment (intensive lifestyle intervention [ILI] vs. diabetes support and education [DSE]).
RESULTS:
Of 100 participants analyzed, 52% were women, and 36% were black, with a mean age of 61.1 years. In the DSE group, mean weight and VAT changed by 0.1 % (p=0.90) and 4.3% (p=0.39), respectively. In the ILI group, mean weight and VAT decreased by 8.0% (p0.001) and 7.7% (p=0.01), respectively. Across both groups, mean weight decreased by 3.6% (p0.001), and mean VAT decreased by 1.2% (p=0.22); the decrease in VAT was correlated with the increase in HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C; R=-0.37; p=0.03). There were no correlations between changes in VAT and blood pressure, triglycerides, LDL-C, glucose, or HbA1c. After adjusting for age, race, gender, baseline metabolic values, fitness, and treatment group, changes in HDL-C were not associated with changes in VAT, while weight changes were independently associated with decrease in glucose, HbA1c, and increase in HDL-C.
CONCLUSIONS:
VAT reduction was not correlated with improvements of <b>CVD</b> risk factors in a sample of overweight and obese adults with type 2 diabetes after adjusting for weight loss.
</td></tr><tr><td>84</td><td>29259801</td><td>Treatment with liraglutide may improve markers of <b>CVD</b> reflected by reduced levels of apoB.</td><td>Background:
Dislipidaemia and increased levels of apolipoprotein B (apoB) in individuals with obesity are risk factors for development of cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>). The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of weight loss and weight maintenance with and without liraglutide treatment on plasma lipid profiles and apoB.
Methods:
Fifty-eight individuals with obesity (body mass index 34.5 ± 3.0 kgm2 [mean ± SD]) were included in this study. After 8 weeks on a very low-calorie diet (800 kcalday), participants were randomized to weight maintenance with meal replacements with or without liraglutide (1.2 mg daily) for 1 year. Plasma samples from before and after weight loss and after 1 year of weight maintenance were subjected to nuclear magnetic resonance-based lipidomics analysis.
Results:
After an 8-week low-calorie diet, study participants lost 12.0 ± 2.9 kg (mean ± SD) of their body weight, which was reflected in their lipid profiles (80 out of 124 lipids changed significantly), including reduced levels of apoB, total cholesterol, free cholesterol, remnant cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein and very low-density lipoprotein subclasses. After 1 year of maintained weight loss, the majority of the lipids had returned to pre-weight loss levels even though weight loss was successfully maintained in both groups. Interestingly, apoB levels remained low in the liraglutide treated group (apoB change: 0.03 ± 0.02 mmolL, p = 0.4) in contrast to an increase in the control group (apoB change: 0.06 ± 0.07 mmolL, p = 0.02).
Conclusion:
An 8-week low-calorie diet, in individuals with obesity, reduced plasma levels of lipids and the atherogenic marker apoB. After 1 year of weight maintenance, only study participants treated with liraglutide maintained reduced levels of apoB, despite similar body weight maintenance. Treatment with liraglutide may therefore reduce apoB levels and thus reflect lower <b>CVD</b> risk. Including apoB measurements in clinical practice when monitoring patients with dislipidemia or <b>CVD</b> might prove to be useful.

Understanding the interplay between adiposity, inflammation, and cardiovascular complications in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remains a challenge. Signaling from adipocytes is considered important in this context. Adiponectin is the most abundant adipocytokine and has been associated with various measures of cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>). This study examines the relationships between genetic variants in the adiponectin (ADIPOQ) and adiponectin-related signaling pathway genes and measures of subclinical <b>CVD</b> (vascular calcified plaque and carotid intima-media thickness), plasma lipids, and inflammation in T2DM.
DESIGN AND METHODS:
Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ADIPOQ (n = 45), SNPs tagging ADIPOR1 (n = 6), APIPOR2 (n = 8), APPL1 (n = 6) and known rare coding variants in KNG1 (n = 3) and LYZL1 (n = 3) were genotyped in 1220 European Americans from the family-based Diabetes Heart Study. Associations between SNPs and phenotypes of interest were assessed using a variance components analysis with adjustment for age, sex, T2DM-affected status, and body mass index.
RESULTS:
There was minimal evidence of association between SNPs in the adiponectin signaling pathway genes and measures of calcified plaque; eight of the 71 SNPs showed evidence of association with subclinical <b>CVD</b> (P = 0.007-0.046) but not with other phenotypes examined. Nine additional SNPs were associated with at least one of the plasma lipid measures (P = 0.008-0.05).
CONCLUSION:
Findings from this study do not support a significant role for variants in the adiponectin signaling pathway genes in contributing to risk for vascular calcification in T2DM. However, further understanding the interplay between adiposity, plasma lipids, and inflammation may prove important in the prediction and management of cardiovascular complications in T2DM.

A DPP-4I, anagliptin (1,200 ppm), or an α-GI, miglitol (600 ppm), in the diet was administered for 47 wk to Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats, a model for spontaneously-developed type 2 diabetes, at the IGT stage. We examined whether each treatment reduced the expression of <b>CVD</b> risk factors such as inflammatory cytokinescytokine-like factors in peripheral leukocytes and adhesion molecules in the aortic tissues and circulation. Treatment with either drug reduced IGT development and repressed expression of the interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, S100a9, and S100a11 genes in peripheral leukocytes in the fasting state at weeks 25 and 39. The mRNA levels of E-selectin in aortic tissues and protein levels of the soluble forms of E-selectin and ICAM-1 in arterial blood were significantly lower in the anagliptin and miglitol groups than in the control group. Our results suggest that long-term treatment with anagliptin or miglitol in OLETF rats at the IGT stage suppresses the expression of inflammatory cytokines in peripheral leukocytes and adhesion molecules in aortic tissues.</td></tr><tr><td>87</td><td>20819236</td><td>Engaging community pharmacists in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: protocol for the Pharmacist Assessment of Adherence, Risk and Treatment in Cardiovascular Disease (PAART <b>CVD</b>) pilot study.</td><td>BACKGROUND:
Cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>) is the leading cause of death globally. Community pharmacist intervention studies have demonstrated clinical effectiveness for improving several leading individual <b>CVD</b> risk factors. Primary prevention strategies increasingly emphasise the need for consideration of overall cardiovascular risk and concurrent management of multiple risk factors. It is therefore important to demonstrate the feasibility of multiple risk factor management by community pharmacists to ensure continued currency of their role.
METHODSDESIGN:
This study will be a longitudinal pre- and post-test pilot study with a single cohort of up to 100 patients in ten pharmacies. Patients aged 50-74 years with no history of heart disease or diabetes, and taking antihypertensive or lipid-lowering medicines, will be approached for participation. Assessment of cardiovascular risk, medicines use and health behaviours will be undertaken by a research assistant at baseline and following the intervention (6 months). Validated interview scales will be used where available. Baseline data will be used by accredited medicines management pharmacists to generate a report for the treating community pharmacist. This report will highlight individual patients' overall <b>CVD</b> risk and individual risk factors, as well as identifying modifiable health behaviours for risk improvement and suggesting treatment and behavioural goals. The treating community pharmacist will use this information to finalise and implement a treatment plan in conjunction with the patient and their doctor. Community pharmacists will facilitate patient improvements in lifestyle, medicines adherence, and medicines management over the course of five counselling sessions with monthly intervals. The primary outcome will be the change to average overall cardiovascular risk, assessed using the Framingham risk equation.
DISCUSSION:
This study will assess the feasibility of implementing holistic primary <b>CVD</b> prevention programs into community pharmacy, one of the most accessible health services in most developed countries.

By virtue of their unique composition, nuts are likely to beneficially affect cardiovascular health. Epidemiological studies have associated nut consumption with a reduced incidence of CHD in both sexes and of diabetes in women, but not in men. Feeding trials have clearly demonstrated that consumption of all kinds of nuts has a cholesterol-lowering effect, even in the context of healthy diets. There is increasing evidence that nut consumption has a beneficial effect on oxidative stress, inflammation and vascular reactivity. Blood pressure, visceral adiposity and the metabolic syndrome also appear to be positively influenced by nut consumption. Contrary to expectations, epidemiological studies and clinical trials suggest that regular nut consumption is not associated with undue weight gain. Recently, the PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea randomised clinical trial of long-term nutrition intervention in subjects at high cardiovascular risk provided first-class evidence that regular nut consumption is associated with a 50 % reduction in incident diabetes and, more importantly, a 30 % reduction in <b>CVD</b>. Of note, incident stroke was reduced by nearly 50 % in participants allocated to a Mediterranean diet enriched with a daily serving of mixed nuts (15 g walnuts, 7.5 g almonds and 7.5 g hazelnuts).

Genome-wide association studies have been linking polymorphisms in this locus with <b>CVD</b> and several other major diseases such as diabetes and cancer. The role of this non-coding RNA in atherosclerosis progression is still poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the implication of ANRIL in the modulation of gene sets directly involved in atherosclerosis. We designed and tested siRNA sequences to selectively target two exons (exon 1 and exon 19) of the transcript and successfully knocked down expression of ANRIL in human aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (HuAoVSMC). We used a pathway-focused RT-PCR array to profile gene expression changes caused by ANRIL knock down. Notably, the genes affected by each of the siRNAs were different, suggesting that different splicing variants of ANRIL might have distinct roles in cell physiology. Our results suggest that ANRIL splicing variants play a role in coordinating tissue remodeling, by modulating the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis, extra-cellular matrix remodeling and inflammatory response to finally impact in the risk of cardiovascular disease and other pathologies.</td></tr><tr><td>90</td><td>25862452</td><td>Cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>) risk factors in Kraków and in the whole Poland adult population.

The striking observation was that in Krakow proportions of participants with university education were substantially higher than average for the other big towns and the whole Poland. Also, the proportion of occupationally active men and women was the highest in Krakow. In both sexes, prevalence of smoking, hypercholesterolemia and hypertension in Krakow was similar to the other big towns but the prevalence of hypercholesterolemia and hypertension (in men only) was lower than average for Poland. The distribution by SCORE risk categories were similar in all three samples studied. In general, the distribution by BMI categories was less favourable but the prevalence of central obesity was lower among residents of Kraków than among residents of the other big towns and citizens of the whole Poland. Prevalence of diabetes was higher in Krakow than in the other samples studied. The differences between population of Krakow and population of other parts of Poland in the exposure to the main risk factors were found diverse and not big enough to be followed by differences in the distribution by the categories of SCORE risk assessment. The study suggested the importance of obesity and diabetes which are not used for the SCORE risk assessment and especially the importance of psychosocial and economic factors which may influence <b>CVD</b> risk and contribute more to the explanation of the regional differences in <b>CVD</b> mortality.
</td></tr><tr><td>91</td><td>22841454</td><td>The contribution of stress to the social patterning of clinical and subclinical <b>CVD</b> risk factors in African Americans: the Jackson Heart Study.</td><td>It is often hypothesized that psychosocial stress may contribute to associations of socioeconomic position (SEP) with risk factors for cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>). However, few studies have investigated this hypothesis among African Americans, who may be more frequently exposed to stressors due to social and economic circumstances. Cross-sectional data from the Jackson Heart Study (JHS), a large population-based cohort of African Americans, were used to examine the contributions of stressors to the association of SEP with selected cardiovascular (<b>CVD</b>) risk factors and subclinical atherosclerotic disease. Among women, higher income was associated with lower prevalence of hypertension, obesity, diabetes and carotid plaque and lower levels of stress. Higher stress levels were also weakly, albeit positively, associated with hypertension, diabetes, and obesity, but not with plaque. Adjustment for the stress measures reduced the associations of income with hypertension, diabetes and obesity by a small amount that was comparable to, or larger, than the reduction observed after adjustment for behavioral risk factors. In men, high income was associated with lower prevalence of diabetes and stressors were not consistently associated with any of the outcomes examined. Overall, modest mediation effects of stressors were observed for diabetes (15.9%), hypertension (9.7%), and obesity (5.1%) among women but only results for diabetes were statistically significant. No mediation effects of stressors were observed in men. Our results suggest that stressors may partially contribute to associations of SEP with diabetes and possibly hypertension and obesity in African American women. Further research with appropriate study designs and data is needed to understand the dynamic and interacting effects of stressors and behaviors on <b>CVD</b> outcomes as well as sex differences in these effects.</td></tr><tr><td>92</td><td>18521688</td><td>Development and pilot evaluation of literacy-adapted diabetes and <b>CVD</b> education in urban, diabetic African Americans.</td><td>BACKGROUND:
Despite prevalent low literacy nationally, empirical research on the development and testing of literacy-adapted patient education remains limited.
OBJECTIVE:
To describe procedures for developing and evaluating usability and acceptability of an adapted diabetes and <b>CVD</b> patient education.
DESIGN:
Materials adaptation for literacy demand and behavioral activation criteria, and pre-post-test intervention evaluation design.
PARTICIPANTS:
Pilot sample of 30 urban African-American adults with type 2 diabetes with Below Average literacy (n = 15) and Average literacy (n = 15).
MEASUREMENTS:
Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT-3, Reading), assessment of diabetes and <b>CVD</b> knowledge, and patient rating scale.
RESULTS:
Reading grade levels were:  12th, 30%; 10th-12th, 20%; 7th-9th, 10%; 4th-6th grade, 10%; and  or = 3rd grade or unable to complete WRAT-3, 30%. Education materials were modified to a reading level of  or = 4th grade. Knowledge improved for Below Average (2.7 to 4.7, p = 0.005) and Average (3.8 to 5.7, p = 0.002) literacy groups, with up to a ten-fold increase, at post-education, in the number of participants responding correctly to some content items. The print materials and class received maximum usability and acceptability ratings from patients.
CONCLUSIONS:
Development of patient education meeting very low literacy criteria was feasible, effective for knowledge acquisition, and highly acceptable irrespective of literacy level.
</td></tr><tr><td>93</td><td>18717208</td><td>A faith-based screeningeducation program for diabetes, <b>CVD</b>, and stroke in rural African Americans.</td><td>The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of a faith-based health screeningeducation program to ultimately reduce risk factors for diabetes (DM), cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>), and stroke (CVA) in a southern, rural, African-American population. Over 120 parishioners from four rural African-American churches attended health educationscreening programs offered as a part of their Bible Study. The majority of participants were female, married, with a mean age of 45 years. The program included education about prevention of cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>), diabetes (DM), and stroke (CVA) followed by health screening, individual counseling, and healthy snacks. Prepost test surveys for health knowledge were given. While the prepost health knowledge scores showed some improvement, they were not statistically significant indicating the need for more than one program. Participants under age 30 and over age 60 years had the least knowledge on the pretest about these illnesses compared to the middle-age group. Almost 50% were found to have high blood pressure, and 14% had high blood sugar levels of which they were unaware. Participant and pastor feedback was positive and supported the feasibility of ongoing faith-based screening education programs as one way to meet the health needs of a rural African-American population.</td></tr><tr><td>94</td><td>12542011</td><td>Established cardiovascular disease and <b>CVD</b> risk factors in a primary care population of middle-aged Irish men and women.</td><td>Contemporary Irish data on the prevalence of major cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>) risk factors are sparse. The primary aims of this study were (1) to estimate the prevalence of major cardiovascular disease risk factors, including Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, in the general population of men and women between the ages of 50 and 69 years; and (2) to estimate the proportion of individuals in this age group at high absolute risk of cardiovascular disease events on the basis of pre-existing cardiovascular disease or as defined by the Framingham equation. Participants were drawn from the practice lists of 17 general practices in Cork and Kerry using stratified random sampling. A total of 1018 people attended for screening (490 men, 48%) from 1473 who were invited, a response rate of 69.1%. Cardiovascular disease risk factors and glucose intolerance are common in the population of men and women aged between 50 and 69 years. Almost half the participants were overweight and a further quarter met current international criteria for obesity, one of the highest recorded prevalence rates for obesity in a European population sample. Forty per cent of the population reported minimal levels of physical activity and 19% were current cigarette smokers. Approximately half the sample had blood pressure readings consistent with international criteria for the diagnosis of hypertension, but only 38% of these individuals were known to be hypertensive. Eighty per cent of the population sample had a cholesterol concentration in excess of 5 mmoll. Almost 4% of the population had Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, of whom 30% were previously undiagnosed. A total of 137 participants (13.5%) had a history or ECG findings consistent with established cardiovascular disease. Of the remaining 881 individuals in the primary prevention population, a total of 20 high-risk individuals (19 male) had a risk of a coronary heart disease event  or = 30% over ten years according to the Framingham risk equation, giving an overall population prevalence of 2.0% (95% CI 1.3 - 3.0). At a risk level  or = 20% over ten years, an additional 91 individuals (8.9%) were identified. Thus a total of 24.4% of the population were at risk either through pre-existing <b>CVD</b> (13.5%) or an estimated 10-year risk exceeding 20% according to the Framingham risk equation (10.9%). Thus a substantial proportion of middle-aged men are at high risk of <b>CVD</b>. The findings emphasise the scale of the <b>CVD</b> epidemic in Ireland and the need for ongoing monitoring of risk factors at the population level and the need to develop preventive strategies at both the clinical and societal level.</td></tr><tr><td>95</td><td>26425279</td><td>Association between fish and shellfish, and omega-3 PUFAs intake and <b>CVD</b> risk factors in middle-aged female patients with type 2 diabetes.</td><td>BACKGROUNDOBJECTIVES:
This study was performed to investigate the association between the dietary intake of fish and shellfish, and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>) risk factors in the middle-aged Korean female patients with Type 2 diabetes (T2D).
SUBJECTSMETHODS:
A cross-sectional analysis was performed with 356 female patients (means age: 55.5 years), who were recruited from the Huh's Diabetes Clinic in Seoul, Korea between 2005 and 2011. The dietary intake was assessed by a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire and analyzed using the Computer Aided Nutritional Analysis program (CAN-Pro) version 4.0 software.
RESULTS:
In a multiple regression analysis after the adjustment for confounding factors such as age, BMI, duration of diagnosed T2D, alcohol consumption, fiber intake, sodium intake, and total energy intake, fish and shellfish intake of the subjects was negatively associated with triglyceride and pulse wave velocity (PWV). Omega-3 PUFAs intake was negatively associated with triglyceride, systolic blood pressures, diastolic blood pressures, and PWV. The multiple logistic regression analysis with the covariates showed a significant inverse relationship between the omega-3 PUFAs consumption and prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia [OR (95% CI) for greater than the median compared to less than the median: 0.395 (0.207-0.753)].
CONCLUSIONS:
These results suggest that the consumption of fish and shellfish, good sources of omega-3 PUFAs, may reduce the risk factors for <b>CVD</b> in the middle-aged female patients with T2D.
</td></tr><tr><td>96</td><td>24450411</td><td>Cardiovascular health in adolescents with type 1 diabetes: the SEARCH <b>CVD</b> study.</td><td>OBJECTIVE:
In their Strategic Impact Goal Statement, the American Heart Association focused on primordial prevention of cardiovascular risk factors by defining metrics for ideal cardiovascular health (ICH). The prevalence of ICH among youth with type 1 diabetes is unknown. Youth with type 1 diabetes face an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>) as they age. The purpose of this report was to examine the prevalence of ICH in a population of youth with type 1 diabetes and to examine the association of ICH with measures of cardiovascular structure and function.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS:
This report is based on SEARCH <b>CVD</b> an ancillary study to the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth. A total of 190 adolescents with type 1 diabetes had complete data on all of the ICH metrics at baseline and had measures of arterial stiffness [pulse wave velocity (PWV), brachial distensibility (BrachD), and augmentation index (AIx)] and carotid intima-media thickness completed at a follow-up visit [on average 5 yr after baseline (interquartile range 4-5)].
RESULTS:
No subjects met the ICH criteria for all 7 metrics. Meeting an increasing number of ICH metrics was significantly associated with lower arterial stiffness [lower PWV of the trunk (β = -0.02 ±0.01; p = 0.004) and AIx (β = -2.2 ±0.66; p = 0.001), and increased BrachD (β = 0.14 ±0.07; p = 0.04)].
CONCLUSIONS:
Increasing number of ICH metrics was significantly associated with decreased arterial stiffness, but prevalence of ICH in this population was low. Youth with type 1 diabetes could benefit from improvements in their cardiovascular health.
</td></tr><tr><td>97</td><td>17339901</td><td>Assessing Māorinon-Māori differences in cardiovascular disease risk and risk management in routine primary care practice using web-based clinical decision support: (PREDICT <b>CVD</b>-2).</td><td>AIM:
To describe the cardiovascular disease risk factor status and risk management of Māori compared with non-Māori patients opportunistically assessed in routine practice using PREDICT-<b>CVD</b>, an electronic clinical decision support programme.
METHODS:
In August 2002, a primary healthcare organisation, ProCare, implemented PREDICT-<b>CVD</b> as an opportunistic cardiovascular risk assessment and management programme. Between 2002 and February 2006, over 20,000 cardiovascular risk assessments were undertaken on Māori and non-Māori patients. Odds ratios and mean differences in cardiovascular risk factors and risk management for Māori compared to non-Māori (European and other, Pacific, Indian, and other Asian) patients were calculated.
RESULTS:
Baseline risk assessments were completed for 1450 (7%) Māori patients and 19, 164 (93%) non-Māori patients. On average, Māori were risk assessed 3 years younger than non-Māori. Māori patients were three times more likely to be smokers, had higher blood pressure and TCHDL levels, and twice the prevalence of diabetes and history of cardiovascular disease as non-Māori. Among patients with a personal history of cardiovascular disease, Māori were more likely than non-Māori to receive anticoagulants, blood pressure-lowering and lipid-lowering medications. However, of those patients with a history of ischaemic heart disease, Māori were only half as likely as non-Māori to have had a revascularisation procedure.
CONCLUSION:
An electronic decision support programme can be used to systematically generate cardiovascular disease risk burden and risk management data for Māori and non-Māori populations in routine clinical practice in real-time. Moreover, the PREDICT-<b>CVD</b> programme has established one of the largest cohorts of Māori and non-Māori ever assembled in New Zealand. Initial findings suggest that Māori are more likely than non-Māori to receive drug-based cardiovascular risk management if they have a personal history of cardiovascular disease. In contrast, among the subgroup of patients with a history of ischaemic heart disease, Māori appear to receive significantly fewer revascularisations than non-Māori.
</td></tr><tr><td>98</td><td>20054879</td><td>Brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity and cardiovascular risk factors in the non-diabetic and newly diagnosed diabetic Chinese: Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study-<b>CVD</b>.</td><td>BACKGROUND:
Increased arterial stiffness is an important cause of cardiovascular disease (<b>CVD</b>). We examined determinants of arterial stiffness in subjects across strata of glycaemic status.
METHODS:
A total of 1249 subjects from a sub-study of the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study (GBCS-<b>CVD</b>) had brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) measured by automatic oscillometric method. Major cardiovascular risk factors including glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA(1c)), high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), fasting triglyceride, low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and both fasting and post 2-h oral glucose-load glucose, systolic and diastolic blood pressure were assessed.
RESULTS:
In all, 649, 479 and 121 subjects were classified into normoglycaemia, impaired glucose metabolism (IGM) and newly diagnosed diabetes groups, respectively. Both age and systolic blood pressure were significantly associated with increased baPWV in all three groups (all p  0.001). In both normoglycaemic and IGM groups, hsCRP and HbA(1c) were positively associated with baPWV (p from 0.04 to  0.001), whereas current smoking and triglyceride were associated with baPWV in the normoglycaemic and IGM group, respectively (p = 0.04 and 0.001). No gender difference in baPWV was observed in the normoglycaemic or IGM groups. However, in the newly diagnosed diabetes group, men had higher baPWV than women (p = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS:
In the normoglycaemic and IGM subjects, after adjusting for age, blood pressure and other confounders, increasing HbA(1c) was associated with increased baPWV, suggesting a pathophysiological role of chronic glycaemia that can contribute to vascular disease risk in persons without diabetes.
